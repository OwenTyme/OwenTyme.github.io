<h3>The Inverted Glass</h3>
<p>In the concluding volume of <em>The Wizard's Scion</em>, Levi faces tragedy beyond anything he's ever experienced before, losing both his wife and firstborn child shortly after the birth.

<h2>Jigsaw City (Series)</h2>
<p><em>Jigsaw City</em> is a sequel series to <em>The Wizard's Scion,</em> centered around the life of Levi's daughter, Nicole Jacobs, and her quest to reunite the pieces of a magical city that was broken up millions of years before she was born.</p>
<p>The first novel of this series has been written and is simply waiting for <em>The Wizard's Scion</em> series to be published. The other two have yet to be written.</p>
<h3>Jigsaw City</h3>
<p>Nicole Jacobs is given a small, hexagonal coin for her twentieth birthday, but during analysis of the strange, magic trinket, she accidentally copies the magic item's base spell into her mind, where it rapidly expands beyond the original design, slowly consuming her mind from the inside! Nicole reluctantly seeks out the maker of the item, hoping to find a cure before it's too late to save her sanity.</p>
<h3>Collector of Kurg</h3>
<p>Having accepted the fact that the City of Kurg is permanently bonded to her mind, Nicole seeks to collect all of the missing fragments of the magical city, both on and off her home planet, soon coming into conflict with rogue trolls, ancient monsters, giants and even fairies.</p>
<h3>The Great Purpose</h3>
<p>In the third volume of <em>Jigsaw City</em>, the true purpose of the magical city is revealed: it was designed as a powerful weapon, for fighting a war that's nearly as old as the universe. The Life Giver is back and in need of Nicole and her city's power, while the Life Taker attempts, once again, to invade the galaxy, to begin consuming the universe.</p>
<h3>Lost City</h3>
<p>Having gone on a suicide mission to save the galaxy from an existential threat, Nicole sacrifices her life to save everyone she loves. Her body is restored by automatic functions of the City of Kurg, but her mind is shattered by her re-birth as the living avatar of Kurg. Lost, confused and alone, will Nicole ever return to her home and those she loves or will she forever wander a dying, parallel universe, seeking a home she can't even remember?</p>
<h2>Ashen Blades (Series)</h2>
<p><em>Ashen Blades</em> centers on the adventures of a half-demon girl (the Hunter) and her friends in an ancient order of demon hunters (The Order of Ash and Smoke).</p>
<p><em>She Who Hunts Demons</em> has already been written and is simply waiting for the appropriate time to be published.</p>
<p>The Hunter will also be seen in <em>The Great Purpose</em> (Volume 3 of <em>Jigsaw City</em>).</p>
<h3>She Who Hunts Demons</h3>
<p>On the backdrop of New York City in 1945, a half-demon girl with an ax to grind with demon-kind over the way they murdered her parents seeks to stop them from harming humanity. Aided by a group of human demon hunters, they seek to thwart the millennia-spanning plans of a demon that claims to be the serpent from the Garden of Eden.</p>
<h3>The Hunter Goes to War</h3>
<p>With the return of her arch-nemesis to the world, in 1972, the Hunter literally goes to war, finding herself drawn to Vietnam, once more backed up by her demon hunting allies, but as all that faced the horrors of the Vietnam war, she finds her time there trying and emotionally difficult.</p>
<p>This novel will draw on the real experience of a Vietnam war veteran, who happens to be the author's friend.</p>
<h3>Demon for President!</h3>
<p>The Hunter's demonic arch-nemesis returns to the world once more, but this time, he's running for president! Worse yet, his unique power to be in multiple places at once allows him to convincingly pretend to be identical twins, running as both a Republican and Democrat! With his best competition being himself, he's practically assured a win!</p>
<p>Hard pressed to get rid of him, the Hunter kills him repeatedly, but he pops back up like a bad weed, making all of his appointments on time, photogenically kissing babies and donating laundered blood-money to charitable causes.</p>
<p>Will the hunter manage to end the demon's presidential campaign before election day or will the USA get a demon for president?</p>
<p>This novel is intended to be released before election day in 2024.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Hunt (Potential Novel)</h3>
<p>When a powerful demon-witch appears in Japan, the Hunter begins a search-and-destroy mission that crosses through famous cities of the Land of the Rising Sun.</p>
<p><em>The Japanese Hunt</em> is a book that Owen hasn't yet made up his mind about. It's only a potential novel, because Owen has no direct experience with a visit to Japan. To get the descriptive details right, he would either have to spend a great deal of time interviewing someone that has or would have to take a research trip there. Unfortunately, Owen doesn't have the money for that.</p>
<h3>The Hunter in Eden</h3>
<p>When the long-lost descendants of the ten tribes of Israel return from the stars in the year 2502 A.D., offering their cousins on Earth the chance to colonize space, the Hunter stows away on one of the colony ships, in pursuit of a demon that seeks to spoil a new Garden of Eden, before it's even constructed. This servant of the arch-demon Sloth seeks to forcefully implant demons in the sleeping mind of every colonist during the decades long voyage between stars, to produce an entire colony of demons.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter stop them or will the demons gain a significant foothold in the universe?</p>
<h3>Smart Bomb</h3>
<p>Having obtained an illegal level of intelligence, comparable to that of a human, a robot seeks to hide and survive on the streets of Neo York City on the planet Neo York, deep within United Nations of the South Galaxy territory. While on the run, it stumbles across a plot to develop a dangerous, new weapon: a hand-held anti-matter explosive. Acting on a deep, moral imperative, the robot decides to do something about it. However, the robot isn't the only one on the trail, stumbling into the Hunter, who's out to kill the demon-scientist developing the bomb for the purpose of opening a portal to the home of demon-kind. Will they team up or tear each other apart?</p>
<p>This novel will be set about 300 years before the time of Zechariah Jacobs (see below).</p>
<h2>Sky Children (Series)</h2>
<p><em>Sky Children</em> is a prequel series to <em>The Wizard's Scion</em>, centered on the adventures of Levi's father, Zechariah Jacobs, an electrical engineer that crashes on a supposedly unexplored planet, which happens to give him magical powers (the Mind Fire virus), making him a wizard.</p>
<p>This series is currently incomplete, needing serious attention and editing before it will be ready for publishing.</p>
<h3>Sky Children</h3>
<p>Zechariah crash lands on an 'unexplored' planet, only to uncover a terrifying government conspiracy to hide the existence of the Mind Fire virus, which grants magic powers to those infected by it.</p>
<h3>Sky War</h3>
<p>As a result of revealing the existence of the Mind Fire virus to the public, Zechariah's new home world catches the eye of his old nation, the Northwestern Empire, which sends an invasion fleet of ships, thousands strong, to wipe out the evidence, so the truth can be erased.</p>
<h3>Wild Sky</h3>
<p>Having settled things with the Northwestern Empire, Zechariah is contacted by the Empire's new empress, who was on his side of the war. With a civil war looming, due to Zechariah's actions, he and his people step up to aid her. However, as things grow ever more dire, Zechariah seeks to achieve ever greater feats of magic and falls to the temptation of using rage magic, a dangerously addictive, but incredibly powerful form of magic. Caught up in the addiction, he begins to destroy his entire life, by hiding it from everyone.</p>
<h2>Independent Novels</h2>
<p><em>Fey Fighters</em> has already been written and is simply waiting for the appropriate time to be published.</p>
<h3>Fey Fighters</h3>
<p>On a distant planet tucked away in a barely explored region of the galaxy, war breaks out between humans that are forced to land there and the fairies that left Earth during World War 2, because the human race had become too violent to share a planet with.</p>
<p><em>Fey Fighters</em> introduces true fairies to the setting, who will also be seen in <em>Collector of Kurg</em> (Volume 2 of <em>Jigsaw City</em>), where they will play a vital role providing exposition and will likely also be a part of <em>The Great Purpose </em>(Volume 3 of <em>Jigsaw City</em>), due to the unusual nature of both demons and fey.</p>
