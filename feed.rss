<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="series">Jigsaw City</h1>
<p><em>Jigsaw City</em> is a sequel series to <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../wizards-scion/index.html">The Wizard’s Scion</a>, centered
around the life of Levi’s daughter, Nicole Jacobs, and her quest to
reunite the pieces of a magical city that was broken up millions of
years before she was born.</p>
<h2 id="plan">Release Plan</h2>
<p>Currently, the plan is to release this series a chapter at a time, on
<a href="https://www.royalroad.com">Royal Road</a>. When each volume has
been fully posted, they’ll be published both in Ebook and print
editions, in many online stores.</p>
<p>For the time being, the Ebooks <em>will not</em> be published via
Amazon, because they have exclusivity requirements that preclude free
distribution via other channels.</p>
<p>Eventually, the versions in their original, online locations will
become short teasers, perhaps six chapters long.</p>
<p>The first chapter of volume one was published on Saturday, March 8,
2025. The rest will follow a chapter at a time, every Tuesday, Thursday
and Saturday.</p>

consuming her mind from the inside! Nicole reluctantly seeks out the

<p>On a distant planet tucked away in a barely explored region of the
galaxy, war breaks out between humans that are forced to land there and
the fairies that left Earth during World War II, because the human race
had become too violent to share a planet with.</p>
<p><em>Fey Fighters</em> introduces true fairies to the setting, who
will also be seen in volume four, where they’ll play a vital role
providing exposition and will also play a part in <em>The Great
Purpose</em>, due to the linked nature of both demons and fey.</p>

is permanently bonded to her mind and soul, Nicole seeks to collect all
of the missing fragments of the magical city from her home world, but
the remaining pieces were deactivated and don’t speak to her in the
irritating way of those among the stars, leaving her frustrated.</p>
<p>Just as she’s researching ways to locate them, a deactivated piece of
the city comes to life and Nicole leads the collection mission, herself.
She meets a dwarf history miner that’s just found both a piece of Kurg
and a fragment of one of the stone men that built Kurg, which whispers
into his mind.</p>
<p>The fragment turns out to be a piece of the Seventh Sage, a mad
prophet that can see the future.</p>
<p>Convinced the Sage knows where the missing pieces of Kurg are, Nicole
seeks to collect the rest of him, but the journey is perilous and Nicole
is forced to take three lives, by her own hand.</p>
<p>Worse things await her, because the Sage harbors a parasitic soul
that’s taken over: one of the most powerful necromancers that’s ever
lived. The ancient witch seeks to defeat Nicole and take her place in
the Sage’s prophesies.</p>
<p>Will Nicole win the day, or will the witch steal both her soul and
her fate?</p>
<p><em>Stone Prophet</em> brings Nicole’s adopted mother into the
series, as Nicole encounters her in the most disreputable port on the
ocean side of the planet.</p>

<p>This is currently planned as a series of short story/novella
collections, but they’re equally likely to become so tightly-bound
together, they’ll become novels. Each will feature a framing story and
largely focus on missions to collect pieces of Kurg, but some “at home”
stories mixed in might be good, involving Nicole dealing with the
cultural melting pot she’s created.</p>
<p>These volumes may end up feeling more like classic sci-fi than most
of my work, due to visits to many alien worlds.</p>
<p>I think I will come up with cover art for each story, mostly for
fun.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h3 id="short-story-seeds">Short Story Seeds</h3>
<ul>
<li>Integrating the fairies from volumes two and four
<ul>
<li>This would be an “at home” story</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Visiting Earth</li>
<li>Called home to Heart Forge, to help deal with a prison break
involving the trolls Nicole found in volume three</li>
<li>Daniel Malachi’s visit to Heart Forge, which was hinted at in volume
3</li>
<li>Chasing the Monkey King
<ul>
<li>Follow-up to the monkeys with crossbows</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Giant with a piece of Kurg
<ul>
<li>This would pair well with the one about shrinking technology</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hidden gas giant station run by pirates
<ul>
<li>May tie in to the Unrooted novella</li>
<li>At least belongs in the same collection</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Visiting the galactic core (high radiation and time dilation)</li>
<li><em>Kaiju Kalamity</em> would focus on defeating giant monsters in
the Eastern Coalition
<ul>
<li>This would be a fun opportunity to once again reuse the pilot of
Jetpack Samurai</li>
<li>Perhaps <em>Jigsaw City</em> needs a squad of mecha?</li>
<li>Could cover the fallout from the kaiju fight in <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../wizards-scion/forgotten-legends.html">Forgotten
Legends</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This list is not quite as big as it needs to be, just yet, but these
little seeds are not so hard to come up with and most were ideas that
got cut from Pricess of Kurg, due to length. On the other hand, my
variation of a “short” story can be rather lengthy, usually four to five
chapters of content, so probably 12k-20k words.</p>
<h3 id="novella-seeds">Novella Seeds</h3>
<ul>
<li>Abandoned penal colony researching shrinking technology
<ul>
<li>Good climax for the first collection</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Jigsaw City</em> vs. the Unrooted Fleet
<ul>
<li>The Galactic core story may be a tie-in or part of this
<ul>
<li>After all, the Unrooted <em>love</em> radiation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>World Song</em> is about a world where magic made every living
thing telepathic via troll song and everything constantly sings, even
plants and microorganisms</li>
<li><em>Baga Yaga Lives!</em> (see below) may becomes a novella, instead
of a novel</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="collection-one">Collection One</h3>
<p>Collection one’s framing story will involve Nicole dealing with the
consequences of the death of a family member.</p>
<p>It will also play with the ideas of both size and consequences. The
giant will be part of it and the abandoned penal colony will be the
climax.</p>
<p>This one will have to open with integrating the fairies.</p>
<h3 id="collection-two">Collection Two</h3>
<p>The second will focus on pirates and skirting around the edges of the
galactic core.</p>
<p>I definitely want to involve the Unrooted, beginning and ending with
them. I think the hidden gas giant station will be one of their bases,
while the big battle between <em>Jigsaw City</em> and the Unrooted Fleet
will be the climax.</p>
<p>Something might be made of the virus that was being engineered in
volume 4.</p>
<p>I may combine the battle with the Unrooted fleet and the visit to the
galactic core, because the Unrooted <em>love</em> radiation. Perhaps the
big Unrooted flag ship flees toward the core, in an attempt to
escape?</p>
<p>Alternatively, the battle with the Unrooted will become a real
butcher shop, with the Unrooted getting their butts handed to them. That
may cause their leaders to flee toward the core, thinking to try again
in a far-flung future, using the time dilation of the block hole at the
core to their advantage. They won’t expect <em>Jigsaw City</em> to
follow.</p>
<h3 id="collections-three-may-need-a-fourth">Collections Three (May need
a Fourth)</h3>
<p>This might might focus on visiting the eastern portion of the United
Nations of the South Galaxy, as well as the Eastern Coalition, so I
should come up with some story seeds related to oriental and Slavic
cultures.</p>
<p>I’m debating making <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/index.html#baba-yaga-lives">Baba Yaga Lives!</a>
the climax of this collection. That would fit well with using Slavic
culture.</p>
<p>Alternatively, I may separate the oriental and Slavic bits into two
separate collections, depending on where my research takes me.</p>
<p><em>World Song</em> might work well as a piece that explores the
individualism of western cultures contrasted with the community and
family-centric views of eastern cultures, because putting the individual
last and the collective first is meant to be the focus of that story.
<em>World Song</em> may become the end of the fourth volume.</p>
<h2 id="baba-yaga-lives">Baba Yaga Lives!</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-BabaYagaLives.jpg" /></span> Baba Yaga started
out wanting to live a little longer, falling to the temptations of
necromancy to extend her life, gaining a mere decade or so with each
human soul she consumed. Eventually growing dissatisfied with such
meager fare, she turned her attention to consuming the souls of magical
creatures for the extra power they contain and her body slowly became
more magic than flesh, transforming her into a thaumavore.</p>
<p>However, with the rise of science and magical creatures of the galaxy
growing wise to her tricks, there’s precious little for her to eat. She
can’t afford the hefty price enchanted items sell for on the galactic
market and finds their weak magic unsatisfying, anyway, but she does
come across a rare and undervalued curio: one of the hexagonal coins
that make up the magical City of Kurg, an object so impossibly filled
with magic, it has the power to resist her every attempt to consume
it!</p>
<p>She seeks to unlock the hidden power of the coin, hoping to extend
her life until the end of time with its nearly limitless magic.
Unfortunately for her, not just anyone can access the magic of Kurg,
something only a city administrator can authorize. Learning this fact by
touching the mind of the coin, she seeks a conversation with Nicole, who
happens to be an administrator.</p>
<p>Nicole’s quest to collect the missing pieces of the City of Kurg
brings her right to Baba Yaga’s doorstep, but since their goals are
nothing alike and totally at odds, the meeting devolves into a magical
duel! War for ownership of the city follows, eventually leading to a
sprawling battle inside the legendary chicken-legged hut of Baba Yaga, a
magically-folded, mind-bending space that would give even M. C. Escher a
headache!</p>
<p>Will Nicole overcome the crone’s superior, time-tested spells or will
Nicole, as an extension of Kurg, become Baba Yaga’s living larder?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Baba Yaga Lives!</em> will bring legendary magical creatures to
the city, including Levi’s old familiar, Inorath, because Nicole will
need information on Baba Yaga and many of them are even older than the
ancient witch.</p>
<h2 id="the-great-purpose">The Great Purpose</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-TheGreatPurpose.jpg" /></span> <em>The Great
Purpose</em> will start with a visit to the planet Neo York and the
Hunter from <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../ashen-blades/index.html">Ashen Blades</a> will
somehow end up in <em>Jigsaw City</em>. That will initially lead
directly to a nasty fight between Nicole and the Hunter, because she’s
seen Nicole’s dragon before, back when the beast was a demon.</p>
<p>Just as they’re working out the details of pecking order, one of the
most dangerous demons in existence will arrive in <em>Jigsaw City</em>
and the two heroines will be forced to work together, along with the
Queen of the Fairies, because the Hunter doesn’t know the city or the
demon in question and Nicole doesn’t know much at all about demons, in
general.</p>
<p>The demon is the corrupt, original version of Nicole’s aunt and she
has one goal in mind: killing Nicole’s birth mother, Lyra. She considers
it her pleasure to cut a bloody swath through both <em>Jigsaw City</em>
and Nicole to get what she wants.</p>
<p>The novel will culminate in the demons finally opening a stable
portal to the Milky Way, out of which star ships of a demonic design
will surge. That’s an emergency like no other the Milky Way has faced
before, leading to a clash between two whole galaxies, with the freedom
of the entire multiverse at stake.</p>
<p>Every faction of the Milky Way will come together to fight for their
right to survive, including the Northwestern Empire, the UNSG, the EC,
Heart Forge, the <em>Jigsaw City</em> fleet and the legends, including
all the gods and monsters that humanity has ever believed in,
particularly the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>The various fairy queens of each fey species will give their power to
their chosen representative, unifying their royal power in a Queen with
the might of the ages. This is likely to be a fairy of Unseelie origin,
allowing the ancient power of the Unseelie and Seelie Queens to rest on
the same shoulders.</p>
<p>The Hunter will take the last of the elemental spirits into her body,
which is the Life Spirit/Life Giver and she’ll aim to fight The Void,
face to face, to put a final end to the war between humanity and the
demons.</p>
<p>The battle with the demon fleet will be a vicious one, with
<em>Jigsaw City</em> leading the charge, in an attempt to force their
way through the portal, to stem the tide of evil from the other
side.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="lost-city">Lost City</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-LostCity.jpg" /></span> Nicole and the Hunter
may have won the battle with demon-kind and The Void, but the cost is
extremely high: Nicole sacrificed her life for the success of their
crazy suicide mission and the Hunter finally reached the limits of both
her demon and witch powers, with disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Nicole’s body is restored by automatic functions of the City of Kurg,
but her mind is shattered by her re-birth as its living avatar. Lost,
confused and alone, will Nicole ever return to her home and those she
loves or will she forever wander a dying, parallel universe, seeking a
home she can’t even remember?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Hunter is also lost and alone, but in immediate peril.
She emerges from the spatial tear formed by The Void’s final kick at
thirty-thousand feet above a strange, alien planet, with absolutely no
idea where she is. Even worse, she’s lost the power of the elements and
been left to her own devices, totally unable to fly. Will she survive
the fall and find some way to get home or will she remain forever
lost?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="the-memory-hunt">The Memory Hunt</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>Nicole discovers the fact that her memories were backed up by the
city before she was killed, but unlike her body, it was unable to fully
restore her mind.</p>
<p>Seeking to regain a greater measure of humanity, Nicole goes back to
collecting lost fragments of the City of Kurg, mostly for the sake of
restoring her memories.</p>
<p>This takes her beyond the galaxy she knows, to far-flung areas of the
multiverse, because when the ancient city broke up, parts of it left the
galaxy, while some few traveled to parallel universes.</p>

and magical City of Kurg, but as a result of a recent battle, pieces of
the city were scattered all over her world. Worse, unlike the ones
scattered around the galaxy, which constantly talk to her, nagging to be
whole again, they’re quiet and deactivated.</p>
<p>As she struggles with the question of how to find them, she senses a
piece of the city coming to life again and she’s drawn like a moth to
the flame, to an ancient ruin built by the stone men that made the city.
There, she meets a dwarf history miner, who holds the piece, which is
folded up like a little coin.</p>
<p>More interesting, however, is an amber lens in his possession that
shows glimpses of the past and future when looked through. Even more
odd, it’s been whispering into the dwarf’s mind. The strange object is
presented to the stone men, who know what it is: it’s a piece of the
Seventh Sage, one of their people with a prophetic gift.</p>
<p>Nicole leads a team on a series of missions to collect the Sage in
the hopes he can locate the missing pieces of Kurg. The journey is harsh
and emotionally painful, because Nicole is forced to kill, not just
once, but three times, leaving her distraught, because she wishes she’d
found another way.</p>
<p>Collecting the last piece is especially difficult, forcing her to
test her resolve with the life of a friend hanging in the balance.</p>
<p>Nicole completes the Sage, but little does she know, a great and
powerful enemy lurks within his mind, an ancient and powerful witch
whose powers are in a class of their own.</p>
<p>Will Nicole rise to the challenge and fulfill prophesy by becoming
the Leader of the stone men, or will the parasitic soul that’s taken
over the Sage steal her fate?</p>

Hunter never wanted to go to war, but in 1972, she senses the return of
her demonic arch-nemesis, Vogerath, to the world. Following his magic
like a bloodhound, she finds herself inexplicably drawn to Vietnam, a
war zone.</p>
<p>With a pressing need to kill Vogerath, who claims to be the serpent
from the Garden of Eden, the half-demon Hunter is joined by her
detective partner, Clayton Simmons, and a powerful witch, Verda
Bagley.</p>
<p>It was meant to be a simple search and destroy mission, but nothing
in the jungles of Vietnam is ever simple and their plans go off the
rails the moment the Hunter sets foot on the ground. She’s overcome by
the magic of the jungle, which causes her to forget her humanity and
transform into a great, black cat with blue eyes!</p>
<p>Her team are forced to subdue her, to bring her back to her senses,
but the consequences of her instinct-driven actions leave them troubled,
because she killed a demon disguised as an American soldier and his best
friend wants revenge! As this fresh, unwanted conflict comes to a close,
the Hunter’s hands are reluctantly stained with human blood.</p>
<p>Vogerath’s jungle hideout is surrounded by soldiers and the raid
begins, but the Hunter’s plan continues to go wrong. After a unit of
tanks is overrun, the US military throws everything they’ve got at the
demons, inadvertently playing into Vogerath’s hands! The demon grows
stronger with each attack and awaits the power of a nuclear strike,
planning to use it to open a portal to Hell, so endless legions of
demons can march forth to conquer the Earth!</p>
<p>Will the Hunter and her friends stop Vogerath in time or will the
world be conquered by demons?</p>

team of demon-slaying experts is called on to investigate. However, to
make things even worse, the Hunter’s team leader sends her into the camp
as an undercover operative, under the guise of a regular teen, despite
the fact that the half-demon girl being old enough to be the grandmother
of the kids at camp.</p>
<p>She’s soon caught up in the daily minutiae of camp, learning a few
new things along the way, while followed around like a puppy by a new
“friend”, a motor-mouthed girl that never shuts up. On the very first
day, she also acquires a trio of teenage foes in the form of some

every corner, because the owner of the camp, Miss Macie Weber, is an
untrained witch, whose unknowing, haywire magic threatens to kill
everyone by summoning powerful and vengeful nature spirits, on top of
the demons already lurking among the humans at camp!</p>
<p>Will the Hunter find and slay the the demons or will the nature
spirits take offense at her mere presence, because she’s had the Jungle
Spirit stuck inside her head since 1972?</p>

<p>Eventually, I’ll put together a collection of the short pieces,
allowing you to buy them in print, though anything of novella length or

<p>The painter of the universe, known as Life, just wanted to fulfill
her reason for being, by creating a universe full of beautiful wonders
and living things, but her twin brother, Death, exists solely to destroy
her work, leading to an intractable argument about whose work should
prevail.</p>
<p>Eventually, Life partially wins the argument and is allowed to make a
universe without seeing it immediately destroyed, but she doesn’t know
well enough to leave things be, leading to emergent consequences as she
continually interferes, adding new creations to fix the problems she
created, only to see everything balloon out of control, while Death
laughs at everything she does…</p>
<p>Emergent Consequences is a short tale that takes a light hearted view
of the follies of human nature, as seen through the lens of a pair of
extremely fallible creators, whose universe fortunately isn’t our own,
holding up the mirror of satire, so we can laugh at ourselves.</p>
<p>Come read about their journey and hopefully learn a little about
human nature along the way.</p>

the Queen of the Fairies, <em>may she reign forever</em>, Sophorica
breaks them to draw attention to their absurdity, literally painting New
York City red. After all, if the only crime is to be caught and any
offense can be forgiven simply by being sneaky, then the law itself can
only be considered a cruel joke.</p>
<p>Her crime is expunged from history and the human race is none the
wiser, but the Queen, <em>may she reign forever</em>, sentences
Sophorica to perform one act of community service in the human realm for
each human witness. This service takes the form of granting wishes to
human children as their fairy godmother, until they’re happy.</p>
<p>However, the awful truth is that granting wishes rarely brings
happiness, forcing Sophorica to learn as much as she can about her
charges, that she might get them to wish for what they really need,
rather than what they want.</p>
<p>Will Sophorica find a way to free herself from the twisted, unjust
punishment wrought by the Queen, <em>may she reign forever</em>,
successfully demonstrating the flaws in fairy law or will she be forever
banished to the human world as a Fairy Godmother?</p>

from coming anywhere near his employer, all without complaint.</p>

<title>The Book of Newts</title>
<link>https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/index.html</link>
<guid>https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/index.html</guid>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-book-of-newts">The Book of Newts</h1>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/../../images/Cover-TheBookOfNewts.jpg" /></span> <em>The Book of
Newts</em> is a remarkable volume. Paradoxically, while The Book is
exceptionally magical, the information contained within is largely not.
It details every wonder of engineering, science and astronomy that’s
been discovered by its past owners, but this information is only visible
to those with a genetic talent for mathematics. To all others, it
appears to be a thick volume describing every variation of newt that has
ever existed, in meticulous detail, complete with hand-drawn
illustrations.</p>
<p>The Book yearns for new knowledge. To that end, it inspires those
that own it to ever greater heights, taking them to the stars and
beyond, to reach their greatest potential, but nothing in life comes
without a price and its owners rarely foresee the balance coming
due.</p>
<p>While The Book is sometimes willing to wait, it’s never satisfied and
will always drive its owner to the next horizon, to the next discovery,
that it might grow a little thicker under the weight of new
knowledge.</p>
<p>Throughout history, The Book has been the driving factor behind many
things, particularly the colonization of the stars and terraforming of
many worlds, all to serve its insatiable hunger for more.</p>
<p>Witches and wizards are drawn to the magic of The Book, but woe
betide any that choose to stand in the way of the inevitable march of
progress, because The Book has a will of its own and a terrible power to
subtly bend its owner’s mind, leaving them just as hungry for more
knowledge.</p>
<p>At first, The Book seems like a blessing, but it might also be termed
a curse. That’s because it always seems to draw unwanted attention, but
never to itself, and its owners become magnets for trouble of all sorts.
Accusations of witchcraft often follow them, because science beyond the
wildest imaginings of the common man may as well be magic.</p>

<h2 id="plan">Release Plan</h2>
<p>Currently, the plan is to release this series in a manner that
resembles television, with episodes consisting of up to four chapters
and seasons roughly ten episodes long. Each novel of the series will be
analogous to a season of a show.</p>
<p>Each season will be initially free to read on <a
href="https://www.royalroad.com">Royal Road</a>. When each season has
been fully posted, it will be published both in Ebook and print
editions. Eventually, the story will be stubbed (become a handful of
sample chapters that drive visitors to stores) on Royal Road, but not
until the series is complete.</p>
<p>None of the novels will be published as Ebooks on Amazon until the
series has been stubbed, due to exclusivity requirements. The Ebooks
will, however, be available in other online stores.</p>
<p>The first three seasons are done and the first chapter was published
on Monday, January 6, 2025. The rest has been following a chapter at a

<p>Volume one is <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/starwitch.html">Starwitch</a>.</p>
<p>The series begins with Amelia Blackwell, a witch with little magic
talent, but a keen mind, described by the previous owner of The Book as
a prodigy. She accepts ownership of it with curiosity and a voracious
desire to read all she can.</p>
<p>The Book soon gets Amelia and her two older sisters into all sorts of
trouble, because the depth of knowledge Amelia demonstrates breeds
jealousy, strife and accusations of witchcraft for all the wrong
reasons.</p>
<p>Eventually, Amelia constructs a vessel she names <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/starwitch.html">Starwitch</a> and the sisters flee the moon they
once called home, to seek peace among the stars. Instead, they find even
greater strife and a hostile pirate queen that consumes the souls of
witches to extend her own life.</p>
<p>Volume one, titled <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/index.html#starwitch">Starwitch</a>, is available

with the consequences of events from volume one.</p>
<p>Having defeated the pirate queen to rescue her sisters from serving
as fuel for that ancient witch’s life, Amelia flees, but the undead
witch is furious beyond measure and gives chase, determined to run them
down. Even better, the sisters stole her spell-core, leaving the giant,
granite ship dead in space.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that only buys them a little time and the Dead Queen
soon has her ship moving again, to chase after them.</p>
<p>Marta is in bad shape, her soul still linked to that of the Queen,
while Iris grows ever closer to death, due to the magic used to
interrogate her.</p>
<p>The sisters seek assistance from everyone they’ve befriended at every
port along the way, while Amelia plots to gather an armada at the end of
the road.</p>
<p>The pirates are soon up in arms, because the Dead Queen’s lieutenants
smell blood in the water. Things are poised to go from bad to worse,
because sometimes the devil you know is better than the one waiting to
fill the power vacuum…</p>

provides greater detail on The Book and the way it interacts with
Amelia.</p>
<p>The two of them come into direct conflict as Amelia decides to go
back to her home world, to reconnect with the man she loves, while The
Book insists on exploring space. As a result, The Book takes back the
gifts it’s given and Amelia loses the ability to perform vast swaths of
advanced mathematics.</p>
<p>Without that, she can’t plot a direct course through space and she’s
forced to rely on the navigation tables of the Ice Palaces, a grueling,
nine month journey home, rather than a quick few days. With such a long
delay, Amelia is practically assured her man will have moved on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an old enemy from her home world, Lieutenant Colonel
Denholm, launches herself into space with only one thought on her mind:
revenge on Amelia for betraying king and country.</p>
<p>Worse, Denholm is met in orbit by the pirate Captain, Edwina
“Roaring” Rowley, who’s also taken umbrage with Amelia over a matter of
a broken promise.</p>
<p>With conflict looming at every turn, will Amelia get home safely and
find her man, or will everything she cares about be taken from her?</p>

<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/../../images/Cover-Witchhome.jpg" /></span> In volume four, titled
<em>Witchhome</em>, Amelia will arrive at a compromise with The Book
they can both live with.</p>
<p>Amelia builds a magic, flying city to serve as a home and place of
refuge while she explores space, a compromise between her desire to put
down roots and the ceaseless need of The Book to go further.</p>
<p>Her massive construction project soon draws attention from all over
the system. Witches and wizards flock to her cause, drawn like moths to
a flame by the potential. Dwarves first supply the resources required,
but soon see the allure of the project and lend a helping hand, that
they might find the same kind of refuge from prejudice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it isn’t all good news, and the locals of Amelia’s
home moon soon rise up, to burn the “cursed city of witches” to the
ground. To avoid all-out war, Amelia’s people are forced to launch
early, before even basic safety measures can be tested.</p>
<p>Will Amelia manage to have her cake and eat it too, or will all the
troubles she seeks to escape finally catch up to her? Will her people be
able to finish their work along the way, or will <em>Witchhome</em> come
apart before they can reach assistance?</p>

<p><span class="book-cover"><img

<em>Beyond the Horizon</em>, Amelia will finally begin exploring, as the
means to find a place her people can call home.</p>
<p>Amelia flies her magic city full of brave witches, wizards and
dwarves to unexplored space, for the sake of establishing a colony where
they won’t be persecuted for their magical talents.</p>
<p>They carry with them seeds and animals of every kind, with which to
make a new home, plus a population composed of every walk of life,
including every skill that might be required both along the way and at
their destination.</p>
<p>The journey is perilous beyond measure, with strange encounters
aplenty, including lethal space weather, aliens with unfathomable
motives and a hazardous encounter with a black hole.</p>
<p>Will Amelia’s people be able to find a world suitable for
terraforming and the construction of a new home, or will their journey
end with disaster, for over-reaching their grasp? Will Amelia be able to
resist naming that planet Witchworld?</p>

queen, Amelia and her sisters enjoy a short time of peace, until she
decides to go home, to Cakana. She wants to reconnect with a man she
fell in love with, but The Book of Newts has other plans.</p>
<p>When the conflict comes to a head, The Book refuses to cooperate and
takes back the gifts it’s been quietly imparting. As a result, Amelia
discovers it’s been bolstering her exceptional ability with mathematics
and piloting. Left to her own devices, the task of navigating space
becomes potentially deadly, because she can no longer perform the
required calculations in her head, or on paper.</p>
<p>Without that, the journey home will take nine months, rather than
mere days, practically ensuring the man she loves will have moved
on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a duo of deadly witches they left behind, and hoped never
to see again, have since learned to fly through space and wish for a
helping of revenge. Lieutenant Colonel Scarth Denholm is furious with
Amelia for betraying her and she’s got Captain Kristina “Killer” Krauss
with her. Worse, they’re welcomed into space by one of the last pirates,
Captain Edwina “Roaring” Rowley, who also has a bone to pick with Amelia
and her sisters.</p>
<p>Will Amelia survive long enough to reignite the love she once had, or
will she be forced to give up her greatest desire, just to satisfy The
Book?</p>

ancient, undead witch known as the Dead Queen and Amelia attacked the
pirate’s mountain-sized star ship out of pure desperation. She never
expected to actually rescue her sisters, let alone defeat the pirate on
her own ship. Nonetheless, she pulled it off, got her sisters back and
left the pirate queen’s ship helplessly listing through space.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Blackwell sisters, that’s only the beginning,
because the Dead Queen survived and she’s absolutely livid. She seeks
revenge, because the sisters made her look weak, forcing her to save
face by killing them, lest her own lieutenants kill her.</p>
<p>Worse, the soul of Amelia’s oldest sister, Marta, has been
intertwined with that of the Dead Queen, who was using necromancy to
consume it, to extend her own life. That leaves them both stumbling
through the thoughts of the other, each looking for some advantage in a
battle of soul vs. soul, winner take all – even though Marta has no
desire to steal the undead witch’s soul.</p>
<p>Iris, the middle sister, fares no better. Since she managed to resist
interrogation by torture, the Dead Queen instead forced an addiction on
her, offering hits of a pleasure spell for information, until she broke.
Her brain chemistry is so screwed up, she’s unlikely to survive
withdrawal.</p>
<p>The Queen soon gets her ship moving and the chase is on! Will the
Blackwells find refuge and allies to fight off the Queen’s massive ship,
or will everyone shun them, unwilling to take the risk of standing up to
the queen of the pirates, who terrifies even the rulers of the star
system?</p>

on Royal Road</a></span> Home, safety, and a place to belong – they seem
so easy to find, at least for everyone but Amelia Blackwell and her
sisters, who run from accusations of witchcraft at every turn.</p>
<p>It started so simply, with a book. No one might have predicted that a
book apparently filled with pictures of newts might lead to so much
trouble, but <em>The Book of Newts</em> is no ordinary volume on
taxonomic detail of amphibians. The magic book reveals its true nature
only to Amelia, at the age of ten, teaching her mathematics, science and
engineering – subjects she would not otherwise have been exposed to.</p>
<p>Ironically, she and her sisters are accused of witchcraft for having
built a horseless carriage, because to the ignorant villagers, there’s
no difference between magic and science. They settle in a new land, only
to find the same breed of persecution.</p>
<p>In an unusual ray of hope, they’re told of a distant kingdom that
openly accepts witches, but shortly after they settle there, the light
at the end of the tunnel turns out to be an awful house fire surrounding
their gilded cage: they’re drafted into the local military, because
their new nation uses witches as living weapons.</p>
<p>The sisters accept the idea that peace will never be found on the
ground. Looking to the stars, Amelia builds a space vessel powered by
magic and steam, to carry them to a brighter future, hopefully without
the strife that’s always followed them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the people of the stars have their own worries: an
ancient, undead pirate queen, who consumes the souls of powerful witches
to extend her own life. The Dead Queen takes Amelia’s sisters and leaves
the magically-weak engineer to die, all as a sick form of sport.</p>
<p>Will Amelia survive long enough to overcome this greatest of all
threats and rescue her sisters, or will they become fuel to feed the
waning magic of a woman that should have been dead centuries before?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

<p><a href="https://owentyme.itch.io/starwitch">The Book of Newts #1:
Starwitch by Owen Tyme</a></p>
<p><em>Starwitch</em> centers on the life of Amelia Blackwell, the
youngest of a trio of sisters and witches, who start out living on a
moon orbiting a gas giant and eventually use magic to launch themselves
into space, to escape persecution for their witchcraft, as well as some
troublesome political events.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they eventually encounter the Dead Queen, an ancient
undead pirate witch that consumes the magic and lives of other witches,
to extend her own existence.</p>
<p>The series begins with Amelia aboard her magic light sail ship,
<em>Starwitch</em>, just a few days after it was badly damaged and her
sisters were kidnapped by the Dead Queen, left with only enough
resources to follow the far larger ship.</p>
<p>That’s an intentional and cruel choice by the Dead Queen, because
Amelia’s magic is deemed too weak to consume. The Queen instead left
Amelia for dead in the hopes of some sport.</p>
<p>Amelia has just enough resources to attack, but not enough to limp to
safety, so unless she gets back either the mythril spell-core of her
ship or at least one of her sisters, she’s a dead woman.</p>
