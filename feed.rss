Royal Road</a></span> Nicole Jacobs is twenty years old and unsure what
direction to take in life, because the opportunities available to her
are too numerous and no one job fits all of her talents, but she passes
the time doing research on dragons. To that end, she hatches a dragon
egg, but in the midst of the harrowing work required, she dreams of the
ancient, magical City of Kurg, which yearns to be whole.</p>
<p>She soon discovers, based on a chance encounter with a small magic
item she’d been analyzing, that her mind has been dangerously
intertwined with that of the city, which spreads through her brain like
a disease, slowly taking over. At first, she’s able to keep it under
control by suppressing magic within her own head, but over time, it
begins breaking past the road blocks she desperately erects in its path
as it inches toward total control.</p>
<p>Seeking a cure, she’s forced to research the ancient city, while the
clock ticks down on her sanity and ultimately, her life. Meeting the
strange, stone men that made the city, the Ulkun, she finds they have
few answers for her, but suggest that if she locates the Architect of
Kurg, one of their own kind, he might be of some help. Unfortunately,
due to the fact he was trapped inside a small segment of the sealed city
for millions of years, alone, he’s quite insane, unhelpful and worse,
eventually becomes hostile, forming a plan for galactic domination.</p>
<p>Instead, Nicole seeks the Life Giver, the mysterious being that
created the Ulkun and ordered the construction of Kurg, while collecting
pieces of the city, in the hopes of attracting their attention.</p>
<p>Will Nicole find a cure, freeing herself from the clutches of Kurg,
or will she lose control of her own mind, taken over by the magic city?
Will the Architect succeed at replacing everyone in the galaxy with
obedient, magically-animated drones with no will of their own or will
Nicole stop him?</p>

queen, Amelia and her sisters enjoy a short time of peace, until she
decides to go home, to Cakana. She wants to reconnect with a man she
fell in love with, but The Book of Newts has other plans.</p>
<p>When the conflict comes to a head, The Book refuses to cooperate and
takes back the gifts it’s been quietly imparting. As a result, Amelia
discovers it’s been bolstering her exceptional ability with mathematics
and piloting. Left to her own devices, the task of navigating space
becomes potentially deadly, because she can no longer perform the
required calculations in her head, or on paper.</p>
<p>Without that, the journey home will take nine months, rather than
mere days, practically ensuring the man she loves will have moved
on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a duo of deadly witches they left behind, and hoped never
to see again, have since learned to fly through space and wish for a
helping of revenge. Lieutenant Colonel Scarth Denholm is furious with
Amelia for betraying her and she’s got Captain Kristina “Killer” Krauss
with her. Worse, they’re welcomed into space by one of the last pirates,
Captain Edwina “Roaring” Rowley, who also has a bone to pick with Amelia
and her sisters.</p>
<p>Will Amelia survive long enough to reignite the love she once had, or
will she be forced to give up her greatest desire, just to satisfy The
Book?</p>

on Royal Road</a></span> Amelia Blackwell’s sisters were kidnapped by an
ancient, undead witch known as the Dead Queen and Amelia attacked the
pirate’s mountain-sized star ship out of pure desperation. She never
expected to actually rescue her sisters, let alone defeat the pirate on
her own ship. Nonetheless, she pulled it off, got her sisters back and
left the pirate queen’s ship helplessly listing through space.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Blackwell sisters, that’s only the beginning,
because the Dead Queen survived and she’s absolutely livid. She seeks
revenge, because the sisters made her look weak, forcing her to save
face by killing them, lest her own lieutenants kill her.</p>
<p>Worse, the soul of Amelia’s oldest sister, Marta, has been
intertwined with that of the Dead Queen, who was using necromancy to
consume it, to extend her own life. That leaves them both stumbling
through the thoughts of the other, each looking for some advantage in a
battle of soul vs. soul, winner take all – even though Marta has no
desire to steal the undead witch’s soul.</p>
<p>Iris, the middle sister, fares no better. Since she managed to resist
interrogation by torture, the Dead Queen instead forced an addiction on
her, offering hits of a pleasure spell for information, until she broke.
Her brain chemistry is so screwed up, she’s unlikely to survive
withdrawal.</p>
<p>The Queen soon gets her ship moving and the chase is on! Will the
Blackwells find refuge and allies to fight off the Queen’s massive ship,
or will everyone shun them, unwilling to take the risk of standing up to
the queen of the pirates, who terrifies even the rulers of the star
system?</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-book-of-newts">The Book of Newts</h1>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/../../images/Cover-TheBookOfNewts.jpg" /></span> <em>The Book of
Newts</em> is a remarkable volume. Paradoxically, while The Book is
exceptionally magical, the information contained within is largely not.
It details every wonder of engineering, science and astronomy that’s
been discovered by its past owners, but this information is only visible
to those with a genetic talent for mathematics. To all others, it
appears to be a thick volume describing every variation of newt that has
ever existed, in meticulous detail, complete with hand-drawn
illustrations.</p>
<p>The Book yearns for new knowledge. To that end, it inspires those
that own it to ever greater heights, taking them to the stars and
beyond, to reach their greatest potential, but nothing in life comes
without a price and its owners rarely foresee the balance coming
due.</p>
<p>While The Book is sometimes willing to wait, it’s never satisfied and
will always drive its owner to the next horizon, to the next discovery,
that it might grow a little thicker under the weight of new
knowledge.</p>
<p>Throughout history, The Book has been the driving factor behind many
things, particularly the colonization of the stars and terraforming of
many worlds, all to serve its insatiable hunger for more.</p>
<p>Witches and wizards are drawn to the magic of The Book, but woe
betide any that choose to stand in the way of the inevitable march of
progress, because The Book has a will of its own and a terrible power to
subtly bend its owner’s mind, leaving them just as hungry for more
knowledge.</p>
<p>At first, The Book seems like a blessing, but it might also be termed
a curse. That’s because it always seems to draw unwanted attention, but
never to itself, and its owners become magnets for trouble of all sorts.
Accusations of witchcraft often follow them, because science beyond the
wildest imaginings of the common man may as well be magic.</p>

<h2 id="plan">Release Plan</h2>
<p>Currently, the plan is to release this series in a manner that
resembles television, with episodes consisting of up to four chapters
and seasons roughly ten episodes long. Each novel of the series will be
analogous to a season of a show.</p>
<p>Each season will be initially free to read on <a
href="https://www.royalroad.com">Royal Road</a>. When each season has
been fully posted, it will be published both in Ebook and print
editions. Eventually, the story will be stubbed (become a handful of
sample chapters that drive visitors to stores) on Royal Road, but not
until the series is complete.</p>
<p>None of the novels will be published as Ebooks on Amazon until the
series has been stubbed, due to exclusivity requirements. The Ebooks
will, however, be available in other online stores.</p>
<p>The first three seasons are done and the first chapter was published
on Monday, January 6, 2025. The rest has been following a chapter at a
time, every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.</p>
<p>Volume one, titled <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/index.html#starwitch">Starwitch</a>, will be
available to purchase on June 27, 2025, as both an Ebook and in
print.</p>

<p>The series begins with Amelia Blackwell, a witch with little magic
talent, but a keen mind, described by the previous owner of The Book as
a prodigy. She accepts ownership of it with curiosity and a voracious
desire to read all she can.</p>
<p>The Book soon gets Amelia and her two older sisters into all sorts of
trouble, because the depth of knowledge Amelia demonstrates breeds
jealousy, strife and accusations of witchcraft for all the wrong
reasons.</p>
<p>Eventually, Amelia constructs a vessel she names <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/starwitch.html">Starwitch</a> and the sisters flee the moon they
once called home, to seek peace among the stars. Instead, they find even
greater strife and a hostile pirate queen that consumes the souls of
witches to extend her own life.</p>
<p>Volume one, titled <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/index.html#starwitch">Starwitch</a>, will be
available to purchase on June 27, 2025, as both an Ebook and in

with the consequences of events from volume one.</p>
<p>Having defeated the pirate queen to rescue her sisters from serving
as fuel for that ancient witch’s life, Amelia flees, but the undead
witch is furious beyond measure and gives chase, determined to run them
down. Even better, the sisters stole her spell-core, leaving the giant,
granite ship dead in space.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that only buys them a little time and the Dead Queen
soon has her ship moving again, to chase after them.</p>
<p>Marta is in bad shape, her soul still linked to that of the Queen,
while Iris grows ever closer to death, due to the magic used to
interrogate her.</p>
<p>The sisters seek assistance from everyone they’ve befriended at every
port along the way, while Amelia plots to gather an armada at the end of
the road.</p>
<p>The pirates are soon up in arms, because the Dead Queen’s lieutenants
smell blood in the water. Things are poised to go from bad to worse,
because sometimes the devil you know is better than the one waiting to
fill the power vacuum…</p>

provides greater detail on The Book and the way it interacts with
Amelia.</p>
<p>The two of them come into direct conflict as Amelia decides to go
back to her home world, to reconnect with the man she loves, while The
Book insists on exploring space. As a result, The Book takes back the
gifts it’s given and Amelia loses the ability to perform vast swaths of
advanced mathematics.</p>
<p>Without that, she can’t plot a direct course through space and she’s
forced to rely on the navigation tables of the Ice Palaces, a grueling,
nine month journey home, rather than a quick few days. With such a long
delay, Amelia is practically assured her man will have moved on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an old enemy from her home world, Lieutenant Colonel
Denholm, launches herself into space with only one thought on her mind:
revenge on Amelia for betraying king and country.</p>
<p>Worse, Denholm is met in orbit by the pirate Captain, Edwina
“Roaring” Rowley, who’s also taken umbrage with Amelia over a matter of
a broken promise.</p>
<p>With conflict looming at every turn, will Amelia get home safely and
find her man, or will everything she cares about be taken from her?</p>

<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/../../images/Cover-Witchhome.jpg" /></span> In volume four, titled
<em>Witchhome</em>, Amelia will arrive at a compromise with The Book
they can both live with.</p>
<p>Amelia builds a magic, flying city to serve as a home and place of
refuge while she explores space, a compromise between her desire to put
down roots and the ceaseless need of The Book to go further.</p>
<p>Her massive construction project soon draws attention from all over
the system. Witches and wizards flock to her cause, drawn like moths to
a flame by the potential. Dwarves first supply the resources required,
but soon see the allure of the project and lend a helping hand, that
they might find the same kind of refuge from prejudice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it isn’t all good news, and the locals of Amelia’s
home moon soon rise up, to burn the “cursed city of witches” to the
ground. To avoid all-out war, Amelia’s people are forced to launch
early, before even basic safety measures can be tested.</p>
<p>Will Amelia manage to have her cake and eat it too, or will all the
troubles she seeks to escape finally catch up to her? Will her people be
able to finish their work along the way, or will <em>Witchhome</em> come
apart before they can reach assistance?</p>

<em>Beyond the Horizon</em>, Amelia will finally begin exploring, as the
means to find a place her people can call home.</p>
<p>Amelia flies her magic city full of brave witches, wizards and
dwarves to unexplored space, for the sake of establishing a colony where
they won’t be persecuted for their magical talents.</p>
<p>They carry with them seeds and animals of every kind, with which to
make a new home, plus a population composed of every walk of life,
including every skill that might be required both along the way and at
their destination.</p>
<p>The journey is perilous beyond measure, with strange encounters
aplenty, including lethal space weather, aliens with unfathomable
motives and a hazardous encounter with a black hole.</p>
<p>Will Amelia’s people be able to find a world suitable for
terraforming and the construction of a new home, or will their journey
end with disaster, for over-reaching their grasp? Will Amelia be able to
resist naming that planet Witchworld?</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="starwitch">Starwitch</h1>
<p>Starwitch is volume one of <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/index.html">The Book of
Newts</a>, which follows the adventures and trials of a witch that owns
a magical book detailing many secrets of science, engineering, magic and
most particularly, space travel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><a

<a
href="https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/102509/the-book-of-newts">Read
on Royal Road</a></span> Home, safety, and a place to belong – they seem
so easy to find, at least for everyone but Amelia Blackwell and her
sisters, who run from accusations of witchcraft at every turn.</p>
<p>It started so simply, with a book. No one might have predicted that a
book apparently filled with pictures of newts might lead to so much
trouble, but <em>The Book of Newts</em> is no ordinary volume on
taxonomic detail of amphibians. The magic book reveals its true nature
only to Amelia, at the age of ten, teaching her mathematics, science and
engineering – subjects she would not otherwise have been exposed to.</p>
<p>Ironically, she and her sisters are accused of witchcraft for having
built a horseless carriage, because to the ignorant villagers, there’s
no difference between magic and science. They settle in a new land, only
to find the same breed of persecution.</p>
<p>In an unusual ray of hope, they’re told of a distant kingdom that
openly accepts witches, but shortly after they settle there, the light
at the end of the tunnel turns out to be an awful house fire surrounding
their gilded cage: they’re drafted into the local military, because
their new nation uses witches as living weapons.</p>
<p>The sisters accept the idea that peace will never be found on the
ground. Looking to the stars, Amelia builds a space vessel powered by
magic and steam, to carry them to a brighter future, hopefully without
the strife that’s always followed them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the people of the stars have their own worries: an
ancient, undead pirate queen, who consumes the souls of powerful witches
to extend her own life. The Dead Queen takes Amelia’s sisters and leaves
the magically-weak engineer to die, all as a sick form of sport.</p>
<p>Will Amelia survive long enough to overcome this greatest of all
threats and rescue her sisters, or will they become fuel to feed the
waning magic of a woman that should have been dead centuries before?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://owentyme.itch.io/starwitch">The Book of Newts #1:
Starwitch by Owen Tyme</a></p>
<p><em>Starwitch</em> centers on the life of Amelia Blackwell, the
youngest of a trio of sisters and witches, who start out living on a
moon orbiting a gas giant and eventually use magic to launch themselves
into space, to escape persecution for their witchcraft, as well as some
troublesome political events.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they eventually encounter the Dead Queen, an ancient
undead pirate witch that consumes the magic and lives of other witches,
to extend her own existence.</p>
<p>The series begins with Amelia aboard her magic light sail ship,
<em>Starwitch</em>, just a few days after it was badly damaged and her
sisters were kidnapped by the Dead Queen, left with only enough
resources to follow the far larger ship.</p>
<p>That’s an intentional and cruel choice by the Dead Queen, because
Amelia’s magic is deemed too weak to consume. The Queen instead left
Amelia for dead in the hopes of some sport.</p>
<p>Amelia has just enough resources to attack, but not enough to limp to
safety, so unless she gets back either the mythril spell-core of her
ship or at least one of her sisters, she’s a dead woman.</p>

<p>Lyra never intended to cause the extinction of the troll race, but
when she uses the power of troll song to read the mind of a dwarf, she’s
forced to compare her life of abuse to that of a loving family.</p>
<p>Acting for the good of the world, she betrays her family and her race
by revealing the secrets of the trolls. For the sake of the dwarves,
Lyra kills her oldest sister, creating an opportunity for the dwarves to
defeat a disorganized army composed of their brothers.</p>
<p>The middle sister, Lyra’s childhood nemesis and personal tormentor,
Nicole, is furious beyond all rationality over her youngest sister’s
actions, determined to make Lyra pay, no matter the cost! Death would be
too good for Lyra, so Nicole seeks to telepathically destroy her mind,
instead!</p>
<p>Luring her sister into a trap, Lyra drops an entire mountain of ice
on their heads, intent on ending Nicole at the expense of her own
life!</p>
<p>They wake from their frozen sleep thousands of years later in a world
of wonders both scientific and magical. As Nicole escapes, the contest
begins anew and she gains control of a powerful star ship, intending to
use it as a platform for her vengeance!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lyra gains modern allies, including the influential family
and friends of a young wizard, Levi Jacobs.</p>
<p>Will Lyra defeat her murderous sister or will Nicole destroy Lyra’s
mind to fulfill her vow of vengeance? Will Lyra end the troll threat or
will Nicole become a scourge on the entire world, raiding and pillaging
as she sees fit?</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="ideas">Ideas</h1>
<p>This page is a sort of catch-all bin of ideas for novels I may write
in the future.</p>
<h2 id="demon-blood">Demon Blood</h2>
<p>This would be a spin-off of <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html">Ashen
Blades</a> centered around the life of James Simmons. He’s a fairy, like
his mother, Lara, but he appears totally normal until probably the age
of fifteen or sixteen, at which point he’s badly injured and needs an
emergency transfusion.</p>
<p>The only person available at the time with a compatible blood type is
the Hunter/Artemis Watson, a half-demon. She donates her blood and it
activates all of the young man’s dormant powers.</p>
<p>He also turns out to be rather good at demon extermination, able to
force demons to transform, with a touch. He uses this power to forcibly
turn demons into weapons, which he uses to kill others. Best of all: his
power eventually fully drains his weapons of all magic, permanently
killing them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he becomes a half-demon, and the demons now seek to
use him in their plots to conquer the world, very similar to
Artemis.</p>
<h2 id="bloody-innocent-heroes-working-title">Bloody Innocent Heroes
(Working Title)</h2>
<p>I haven’t selected a proper title for this series yet, but <em>The
Four Corners</em> refers to questing all over the world to collect
artifacts. Alternatively, <em>Innocent Blooded</em> or <em>Bloody
Innocent Heroes</em> do also sound suitable. I currently favor that last
option.</p>
<p>Some mysterious and secretive individual brings a group of
adventurers together.</p>
<p>Two of them will be condemned prisoners that have been put in cages
beside one of the main trade routes of the kingdom. Both were caught
red-handed, so to speak, completely covered in the blood of victims they
murdered, though they have no idea why they did it. Each of them
remembers doing the deed, but can’t remember what motivated them.</p>
<p>One will be a priest that should have lost his powers as a result of
his actions, but he hasn’t and he doesn’t know why. He turned himself in
and confessed to his crime. During his trial, he was accused of secretly
working with a death god as an explanation of the fact he retained his
powers, but that isn’t true.</p>
<p>The other is a dwarf warrior/smith, who bludgeoned someone to death
with his smithing hammer, a fact that deeply disturbs him, not only due
to the death, but also from disrespect of his favored tool. He’s
convinced that someone mind-controlled him and he insisted on this story
throughout the trial.</p>
<p>The third member of the party is man that used to be a human thief,
who crossed a wizard and got permanently transformed into a dog, though
he retains his memories, for now. This dog finds the first two in their
cages and takes pity on them, stealing food for them. Unfortunately, he
can’t read or write, putting a real damper on communication.</p>
<p>The priest is bothered by the theft, but accepts the food, because he
will otherwise die. The dog doesn’t like the dwarf, however, because
they initially eye them with great hunger and says, “There’s good eatin’
on a dog, even a scrawny mutt like that.” The priest shares the food
with the dwarf.</p>
<p>The fourth member of the party is an impressionable teenage witch,
who finds them in their cages and sets them free, but she claims she’s
working on behalf of someone else.</p>
<p>In her case, she assaulted someone with a club, but she doesn’t know
why. She’s perplexed by the fact she didn’t know her victim and wasn’t
using magic to attack them. The watch caught her in the act and she was
sold as a slave to pay her debt to society. Her new owner is allowing
her to work off her debt by performing tasks for him, including freeing
the others.</p>
<p>The main characters are mostly grateful for what their benefactor is
doing for them, with the exception of the dog, who’s deeply suspicious,
but can’t express himself properly.</p>
<p>They’re taken by the witch to a secret, mountain fortress, which once
belonged to some bandits.</p>
<p>Only the witch ever speaks with their employer and she passes along
word of what he wants done. Their employer insists that he believes
they’re all innocent and claims he has other agents investigating their
cases, to find evidence to clear their names.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he’ll provide them with food, shelter and even some
spending money, if they’ll search some ancient ruins for a series of
magic artifacts he’s collecting.</p>
<p>The real truth is that the three humanoids are patsies and their
employer is a ghost. He possessed each of them, in turn, taking over
just long enough to get them in serious trouble, while simultaneously
eliminating two of his previous agents and sending a warning message to
a third.</p>
<p>He has no intention of helping his new agents out of the predicaments
he’s put them in.</p>
<p>The artifacts are part of an ancient magical device that can
supposedly grant a ghost some rather serious power, which should be
enough to keep him solid all the time, on top of making him
nigh-invulnerable.</p>
<p>The witch is aware that he’s a ghost, but believes he’s hiding that
fact to avoid scaring the others.</p>
<p>This band of misfits will collect the pieces of the device and the
smith will reassemble it, with the help of the witch.</p>
<p>Just before the device is handed over, the dog will grab it and run
off. The ghost will lose his temper and say too much as he chases. The
others will be shocked by the revelation, ultimately siding with the
dog, leading to a knock-down, drag-out fight with their employer.</p>
<p>The device will be used to force the ghost to pass on to the
afterlife, which is the true purpose it was designed for, and their
first adventure will come to an end, but without clearing their
names.</p>
<p>This could easily become a series, with the characters doing various
jobs while they seek to clear their names and turn the dog back into a
human.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what universe this will be placed in, but <em>The Book
of Newts</em> and <em>Rumors of War/Null War</em> would both be
fitting.</p>
<p>If I choose <em>Rumors of War/Null War</em>, then the witch will be
the one with the dragon trapped inside her body. This is based on a
dragon demi-god trying to eat the entire world, to satiate his
hunger.</p>
<p>The mother of this witch faced the demi-god, alone, while her baby
daughter slowly died of something like a birth defect (she’s a chimera
of a witch and a null, a condition that’s supposed to be impossible to
survive).</p>
<p>Seeking to stop the dragon and give her daughter’s inevitable death
meaning, the mother uses her magic to seal the dragon inside her
daughter’s body, hoping the dragon will die with the infant.</p>
<p>The magic costs the mother her life and the dragon is sealed away,
effectively bonded to the girl’s life force. The mother dies thinking
the dragon is doomed, but the dragon manages to save the girl’s life, in
order to save his own.</p>
<p>The girl has both dragon and witch powers, making her basically
immortal, so long as the dragon remains trapped inside her.</p>
<p>If I go this route, then this series will serve as a prequel to
<em>Rumors of War</em>.</p>
<h2 id="fighter-for-hire-working-title">Fighter for Hire (Working
Title</h2>
<p>In <em>Fighter for Hire</em>, a young and inexperienced fighter
answers an ad from an established group of adventurers seeking a
front-liner. He interviews for the position and is given a trial period
to prove himself in the field, while the group takes on a low priority
job, to try him out.</p>
<p>As they work, the fighter asks why they needed a fighter and the
others begin to tell the story of what happened to their old fighter,
each of them taking turns at telling the story. Each character
interrupts the narrative when they think the previous person is missing
or glossing over details, taking over the story.</p>
<p>Each chapter will be from the perspective of the current storyteller,
with short meta elements and arguments over details.</p>
<p>The overall tale will be about their last big job, which went wrong.
Each part of the story will illuminate a small point of how things went
wrong, contributing to the overall failure that lead to the death of
their missing friend.</p>
<p>The start of the climax will cover their fight with the big boss of
the dungeon/bandit leader/dragon/whatever it is they were working to
eliminate. It will end with the group losing their fighter and only
barely escaping with their lived.</p>
<p>The true climax will involve the group tackling the same job again,
with their new fighter. Armed with a more serious approach informed by
their past failures, they’ll win the day.</p>
<h2 id="second-star-working-title">Second Star (Working Title)</h2>
<p>Second star is a re-telling of Peter Pan from the perspective of
Captain Hook, with Peter cast as the villain. The setting would be based
on a twisting of many fairy tales and I’m planning to go for a gritty,
realistic feeling to the story, despite the fact it will be satire. I
may go with a Noir-style of writing, with guns and tech from the 1940’s,
though there will certainly also be magic and magical creatures.</p>
<p>Hook would be a police captain with a personal grudge against Pan,
who’s the king-pin of the local drug trade, which is based on Pixie
Dust, a hallucinogen literally produced by shaking enslaved pixies.</p>
<p>True to the original story, Pan cut Hook’s hand off and fed it to an
alligator. That led to Hook being re-assigned from narcotics to vice for
a time, which will lead to Pan nicknaming him “Captain Hooker”, just to
tick him off.</p>
<p>The novel will begin with Tinkerbell turning herself in to the
police, but she refuses to tell her story to anyone other than Hook.
That gets Hook back on the case and he sees things through from there.
Tink and Pan used to be equal partners, but when Tink grew a conscience
and wanted to stop selling drugs to kids, Pan imprisoned her, then
captured more pixies, to force them to produce more Pixie Dust.</p>
<p>I have lots of ideas for incorporating elements of the original
story, as well as many other fairy tales.</p>
<p>For example, Neverland is Pan’s nightclub, a speakeasy that the cops
can’t find, because only fairies and those high on Pixie Dust can see
the way. The directions “second star to the right and straight on till
morning” confuse them, because Second Star and Morning are street names,
but they’re parallel to each other and never cross. Only in the fairy
realm do they actually share an intersection and that’s where Neverland
is. Neverland got it’s name through Pan saying, “The cops won’t never
find this land!”</p>
<p>I plan to include Pinocchio as one of Pan’s street-level pushers.
Hook uses him as a reliable source of information, because every time
the puppet lies, his nose grows. Unfortunately, Hook doesn’t know that
Pan uses the puppet to feed Hook false information.</p>
<p>Pixie Dust has a powerful side-effect on children, slowing or even
stopping the aging process. Pan, for example, is hundreds of years old,
yet he’s never fully grown out of childish habits.</p>
<p>Pan’s gang, the Lost Boys, are nearly as old as Pan. Every one of
them is a nasty piece of work, fully of the cynicism of the streets, yet
childish as can be. Those that appear to be teens, like Pan, are the
most dangerous. They’re intellectually adults, but emotionally volatile
and prone to murderous behavior. Those that appear younger are less
trouble, but due to the way they haven’t mentally developed, they’re
effectively slaves to the older members of the gang and don’t even know
it.</p>
<p>The Lost Boys are constantly looking for new recruits and they easily
find them when children disagree with their parents, usually over petty
matters, like bedtime.</p>
<p>However, they’re just as likely to sell them drugs, instead.</p>
<p>The climax of the novel will involve Pan blowing a handful of Pixie
Dust in Hook’s face, while growling, “Could you just lighten up, for
once?”</p>
<p>At that point, Hook will wander the streets, high as a kite, but
he’ll finally see how the streets bend and cross, at least in his mind.
Before he begins to come down, he gathers men from the station, in full
tactical gear, and leads them in a raid on Neverland, leading to a grand
melee with the Lost Boys, while Hook confronts Pan.</p>
<h2 id="thorn-of-the-rose-working-title">Thorn of the Rose (Working
Title)</h2>
<p>Sandra Blake loses her parents to an unexpected attack by a
mysterious assassin. Her mother’s final words, “Don’t let it end like
this” have a chilling effect on her life and Sandra transforms herself,
both body and soul, becoming an incredibly skilled and dangerous
woman.</p>
<p>After years of intense training, she enters the seedy underworld of
modern society, exchanging stolen jewels for information on the man that
killed her parents.</p>
<p>Her uncle, Daniel Malachi, seeks to bring her in from the field, to
make her part of the Imperial Intelligence Core, which her oversees.</p>
<p>Naturally, they come into conflict, but Sandra goes through Malachi’s
men like a lawn mower cuts grass. Nonetheless, when her uncle speaks to
her, her resolve weakens and she agrees to work for him as a spy.</p>
<p>Will Sandra stay on task and do as she’s told, or will she go
off-book to find the man she wants to punish?</p>
<p>This would be a rewrite of a novel I started in college (20 years
ago), which I lacked the skill to finish at the time.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite qualities of Sandra were the contradiction
between how much pain she feels and how capable she is, as well as her
tendency to defeat high tech security gadgets with simple kitchen
utensils. Add her total lack of understanding of computer software (she
had a rudimentary understanding of networking cables, however, in the
sense of knowing what they were and how to cut them) and she was quite
fun to write.</p>
<p>This more modern variation would take place in the Northwestern
Empire, likely during the time skip at the end of <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/wizards-scion/the-inverted-glass.html">The Inverted Glass</a>.
Daniel Malachi was originally seen in <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/sky-children/sky-children.html">Sky Children</a> and also appeared
in <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/wizards-scion/the-third-wish.html">The Third Wish</a>, after
which he became the new spy master for the Empress of the Northwestern
Empire.</p>
<p>While Malachi is a wizard, he doesn’t flaunt that ability and not
even Sandra will know, at least until she needs to.</p>
<p>The original version of the novel opened with Sandra pretending to be
a student at a clandestine school for spies on the first day of class,
while their teacher was absent. This turned out to be ploy to avoid
teaching, a task she never wanted, but since she’s pregnant, she’s been
removed from active duty and relegated to teaching.</p>
<p>She teaches the Unconventional Tactics class, mostly by telling them
her life story, which serves as an excellent example of doing everything
the wrong way, while getting excellent results.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how much of the old novel will be used, but there’s
plenty to build on and the experience of writing Sandra has had a lot of
influence over the writer I’ve become.</p>
<h2 id="the-renegade-god">The Renegade God</h2>
<p>In a humorous setting in which gods gain power through human belief,
one particular goddess has a tendency to step on the toes of other gods,
by gaining aspects that are uncomfortably close to their areas of
influence, ultimately usurping them, by stealing their worshipers.</p>
<p>For this, she’s cursed by the other gods, yet she isn’t dissuaded,
continually visiting the mortal realm to spreads new religions based on
her. She usually reaches by falling from the sky, because shes initially
pushed off the cloud that serves as the home of the gods, but over time,
she will choose to dive off.</p>
<p>Every time she lands, she leaves a crater and loses her memories, not
realizing she’s a god. She usually also loses her divine regalia along
the way, including a pair of ruby high heels that bear a measure of her
power. It normally takes her years to recover her memories, long after
she’s spread a new religion.</p>
<p>She eventually finds her pet goose, which goes out looking for her
whenever she leaves the abode of the gods, and rides it home. Every
visit home leads to a new trial for her crimes against the other gods,
for which she’s cast down again, starting the process anew.</p>
<p>This is likely to read like a series of intertwined tales, but it
won’t be a collection of short stories, because the narrative will be
tighter than that.</p>
<p>By the end of the novel, the renegade will become the chief of the
gods, simply because she has more worshipers than any other.</p>
<p>I’ll play up the renegade’s curse for comedic effect and treat her
relationship with the other gods as another source of comedy.</p>
<h2 id="marie-antionette"><sup>Marie</sup>/<sub>Antoinette</sub></h2>
<p>This piece will be strictly a sci-fi novel and will also stand alone.
It’s possible I could turn it into a series, but I currently have no
plans for that.</p>
<p>Marie is an undercover cop with multiple personalities. The two
personalities are Marie and <em>The Other Girl</em>, an old name Marie
chose for her second personality as a child. She has a talent for
computers and even a little knowledge of hacking, a skill she
occasionally uses on the job.</p>
<p>She’s part of an operation investigating the owner of a
biotech/cybernetics company, because he’s rumored to be a mobster.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Marie is discovered and the mobster uses her for an
awful experiment. As it turns out, he’s been experimenting with
technology to wipe a person’s mind, followed by rewriting their brain
with a new personality.</p>
<p>The villain didn’t count on Marie having two personalities, however,
and the technology doesn’t quite work. <em>The Other Girl</em> rises to
the surface, because her purpose is to protect Marie. <em>The Other
Girl</em> is erased and replaced with a new personality named
Antoinette, a little joke from the villain.</p>
<p>Antoinette becomes the villain’s personal assassin, who puts a lot of
cybernetic hardware in Marie’s body.</p>
<p>Marie eventually comes to the surface again, but finds herself
overwhelmed with pain she can’t handle, subsiding again. This is because
the villain took no care for her comfort when he installed the
cybernetics, leaving her pain center constantly stimulated.</p>
<p>As an artificial personality that has more in common with a computer
program, Antoinette doesn’t have an emotional reaction to pain. She does
register new pain as the means to track injury, but she disregards
existing pain.</p>
<p>Marie eventually regains consciousness again, but takes a more
hands-off approach, observing from her own subconscious, while
Antoinette kills for the villain.</p>
<p>Eventually, the facility that radios her with new instructions is
assaulted by the military, led by Marie’s boyfriend. He’s a special ops
soldier and quite eager to find Marie, even though the police department
has marked her down as missing, presumed dead (the villain may have
altered a corpse to look like her, or may have cloned her, just to throw
the police off).</p>
<p>Everyone responsible for giving Antoinette orders is killed or
captured and their equipment is destroyed, something that Antoinette
becomes aware of, due to the network connection going down. She has some
understanding of what happened, but has no orders regarding loss of
contact and doesn’t know what to do.</p>
<p>Antoinette is left with very simple orders: “Stay out of sight and
kill any witnesses until further notice.”</p>
<p>She hides in a slum for a prolonged period of time, until a boy spots
her and approaches. She’s about to kill him, but receives new orders,
despite the fact she knows the transmitter at the other end has shut
down. She’s ordered to never kill children.</p>
<p>Marie is the source of all further orders and she’s managed to hack
the computer hardware connected to her brain, using it to give
Antoinette some new orders, though she can’t yet countermand existing
orders. She can only add fresh orders.</p>
<p>The second order Marie gives causes Antoinette to completely shut
down her radio transceiver.</p>
<p>From that point on, Marie will use Antoinette as a tool to achieve
her own goals. She’ll initially try to contact her friends over the
phone, but can’t get Antoinette to speak, due to prior direct orders
from the villain. Instead, she quietly looks for proof she can deliver
to the police, without being seen, acting in a manner similar to a
vigilante. She delivers trussed-up mobsters to the police station, along
with evidence to ensure a conviction, while she seeks dirt on the man at
the top.</p>
<p>The novel will have a dual plot structure, but both threads will
follow the main character. Marie will be the subject of one thread,
starting with the childhood trauma that gave her a second personality,
while the other will follow Antoinette, starting with her first field
test. I won’t make it clear that they’re the same person until about
halfway through the book.</p>
<h2 id="p.r.o.t.e.g.e.">P.R.O.T.E.G.E.</h2>
<p>The Protective Recon Operations Taskforce for Extraterrestrial
Gathering and Elimination is a multinational organization setup to
protect the human race from aliens, though they’ll deal with most
anything that’s a threat to humanity, including supernatural threats.
They’re a black-budget, paramilitary organization that doesn’t
officially exist.</p>
<p>PROTEGE keeps everything a secret and keeps humanity in the dark
regarding aliens, supposedly for their own good. However, they have a
rather bad reputation for being overly anti-alien, to the point of
needless hatred, but that may or may not be true.</p>
<p>The story will follow a new recruit, a shape-shifting alien in
disguise. His job is to find the real truth behind the disappearance of
a peaceful group sent to study humans. If PROTEGE is responsible, then
it may lead to war. If the alien infiltrator discovers the fact PROTEGE
has multinational support, then the aliens may declare war on all of
humanity.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he’s constantly distracted from his primary mission by
PROTEGE-assigned missions, which keep him in the field, rather than at
home base. Over time, he emotionally bonds with the human members of his
team and begins to lose himself in the role.</p>
<p>I haven’t yet decided on an outcome for the story, but in my mind,
PROTEGE has always been evil, run by humans that hate and victimize
aliens, yet their field operatives are not quite so evil, which may be
what makes it so hard to find the truth.</p>
<p>Perhaps the alien’s goal will transition to replacing the current
leaders of the organization, rather than starting a war, which could
lead to a long struggle over the course of a series. I could easily see
the climax as a confrontation between the alien and the people at the
top. If he wins, then he’ll replace them and subtly change the
organization’s mission. However, since that was basically what happened
in the <em>Supergirl</em> TV show, I think I’ll take a different
approach.</p>
<p>More likely, I would seek a middle-ground path, in which he confronts
them honestly and tells them of the threat they’ve become to themselves.
That will lead to a fight between those that see things his way and the
rest, who refuse to change.</p>
<p>In North America, PROTEGE operates out of an underground bunker
hidden beneath a kitty litter factory, which serves as a cover story.
Officially, the operatives that work out of the base are employed by the
factory.</p>
<p>Naturally, this novel/series would use a lot of conspiracy theory
stuff, most of which would be played up for comedic effect.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-left-to-chance">Nothing Left to Chance</h2>
<p>Death is a job passed from one mortal to another over the centuries,
a job with a great many perks, including immortality, but the catch is a
doozy: death is always scrambling collect to dark souls that need to be
controlled. Worse, if Death fails and the dark souls are left unchecked,
the world will come to an end.</p>
<p>Each Death begins normal enough, then comes to an end the usual way,
but a long-standing bargain between humanity and the grim reaper entails
an ancient ritual challenge: if a mortal can beat Death in any game,
they gain immortality. The trouble is, Death can’t be beat, unless Death
chooses to lose.</p>
<p>This has happened before and will inevitably happen again, because
mortals were never meant to live forever, and sooner or later, the
Reaper always tires of Reaping. It may take ten-thousand years or just
ten, but all good things must come to an end.</p>
<p>The downside is that this usually involves all of the collected dark
souls being released, which forces the new guy to pick up the slack,
lest the world end.</p>
<p>Dragons, monsters, creatures of legend, even dark and forgotten gods
with an ax to grind – they all have to be captured and contained.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the previous Reaper always sticks around for a while,
usually in the form of a talking skull, because someone has to teach the
new guy.</p>
<p>Each book in this series would bear only a tenuous connection to the
rest and each volume in it can stand alone, with no need to write them
in any particular order. Each would focus on a particular Reaper, though
it’s possible I may find I like any given character and give them an
extra volume or two.</p>
<p>The common elements of the series from Reaper to Reaper will consist
of each facing terrible calamities in order to save the world, requiring
some choice of vessel to contain the dark souls, which determines the
powers they manifest. However, all Reapers share the power to manipulate
and travel through time, which is essential for them to ferry the souls
of the living to the afterlife.</p>
<p>In addition, they also have to choose something or someone to serve
as their immortal companion. This is traditionally a horse, but there
are a great many options available, including motorcycles, cars, other
people, etc.</p>
<h3 id="chance-on-a-gamble">Chance on a Gamble</h3>
<p>A young man that lives by gambling dies in a motorcycle accident and
meets Death, who offers him a rare chance at immortality, through a game
of poker.</p>
<p>He wins and becomes Death, while Death crumbles to just a powerless
skull, which had been serving as the containment vessel.</p>
<p>After several women reject the opportunity, the young man chooses his
motorcycle as his companion, which becomes imbued with life, then
chooses to use his deck of cards and his dice to contain the souls. The
powers he gains are extremely strong, but subject to random chance and
tend to burn out after a while.</p>
<p>To challenge myself, I’ll come up with random effects to attach to
the cards of a deck or the roll of the dice, then I’ll randomly choose
as required to determine which power he gets at any given time. During
the climax, he’ll finally find a way to stack the deck ahead of time,
rather than shuffling.</p>
<p>The more souls he gathers, the less time it will take for individual
cards to recharge after use.</p>
<h3 id="gunslingers-chance">Gunslinger’s Chance</h3>
<p>The Reaper of the Old West era began as an outlaw gunfighter, who
challenged death to a fast-draw contest of the sort favored in
Westerns.</p>
<p>Death loses on purpose and the outlaw finally finds out about the
fine print of the arrangement, forced to defend a world he hates,
because the alternative is worse.</p>
<p>The outlaw chooses his horse as his companion and his pistol as the
vessel. Each soul he captures will give him a unique power his bullets
can manifest, based on the defeated monster.</p>
<h3 id="chance-for-a-soldier">Chance for a Soldier</h3>
<p>A soldier that died on the battlefield during World War II defeats
Death in a bare knuckle bar fight.</p>
<p>The soldier chooses his best friend as a companion and their fists
serve to contain the souls. Each soul they collect will give them
greater durability and physical strength, eventually becoming like
super-heroes.</p>
<p>Together, they fight both dark souls and Nazis, but as they begin to
sway the outcome of the war, Reapers from other eras appear, to stop
them, lest they destroy the foundations of reality, by altering what was
meant to be.</p>
<p>The Reapers brawl like no battle that came before and whole cities
are decimated by the fighting.</p>
<h3 id="shinigami-of-chance">Shinigami of Chance</h3>
<p>At one point, the reaper was a Japanese samurai, who used his sword
as the the vessel and his armor as his companion. His armor became
imbued with life and the samurai came to think of it as being possessed
by a helpful, yet very clever fox yokai.</p>
<p>This one chose to think of himself as a shinigami, rather than a
Reaper.</p>
<h3 id="a-chance-insight">A Chance Insight</h3>
<p>The Reaper of this novel is a con artist that makes her living as a
fake psychic or medium.</p>
<p>She chooses her crystal ball as both the containment vessel and her
companion. She gains the rather unreliable power to gaze into the
future, while her crystal ball starts talking and can shape shift at her
command. She often uses it in the form of blunt instruments (like a
mace), since it’s made of extremely durable and heavy quartz.</p>
<h3 id="a-magical-chance">A Magical Chance</h3>
<p>The Reaper from the 1960’s is the lovely assistant of a magician and
also his wife.</p>
<p>She chooses her husband as her companion and makes magic itself the
containment vessel, transforming it into more than a mere slight-of-hand
trick.</p>
<h3 id="the-last-chance">The Last Chance</h3>
<p>The previous Reaper chooses poorly and gives his power to a man that
wishes to watch the world crumble, after losing his wife.</p>
<p>The Earth comes closer than ever to destruction as dark and evil
energy fills the world, fracturing both time and space, bringing Reapers
from the past into the present, each of them fighting to hold off the
catastrophe, despite the fact they lack the power, since they’re only
echoes of what was.</p>
<p>The new Reaper falls for one of the female Reapers of the past and
she convinces him to care, through small acts of romance. He chooses her
as his companion and together, they fight to end the catastrophe, but
the world may be too far-gone to save.</p>
<p>In a strange twist, the Reaper chooses his bond with his new wife as
his containment vessel and the attraction between them manifests as a
force that may be just enough to seal the cracks in space/time, or
possibly not…</p>
<p>This volume would likely be the last, a chance to bring the other
main characters together for one big adventure, while elements of the
real world, the future and even alternate histories mingle together.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="series">Jigsaw City</h1>
<p><em>Jigsaw City</em> is a sequel series to <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../wizards-scion/index.html">The Wizard’s Scion</a>, centered
around the life of Levi’s daughter, Nicole Jacobs, and her quest to
reunite the pieces of a magical city that was broken up millions of
years before she was born.</p>
<h2 id="plan">Release Plan</h2>
<p>Currently, the plan is to release this series a chapter at a time, on
<a href="https://www.royalroad.com">Royal Road</a>. When each volume has
been fully posted, they’ll be published both in Ebook and print
editions, in many online stores.</p>
<p>For the time being, the Ebooks <em>will not</em> be published via
Amazon, because they have exclusivity requirements.</p>
<p>Eventually, the versions in their original, online locations will
become short teasers, perhaps six chapters long.</p>
<p>The first chapter of volume one was published on Saturday, March 8,
2025. The rest will follow a chapter at a time, every Tuesday, Thursday
and Saturday.</p>

her twentieth birthday, but during analysis of the strange, magic
trinket, she accidentally copies the magic item’s base spell into her

explored region of the galaxy, war breaks out between humans that are
forced to land there and the fairies that left Earth during World War
II, because the human race had become too violent to share a planet
with.</p>
<p><em>Fey Fighters</em> introduces true fairies to the setting, who
will also be seen in volume three, where they’ll play a vital role
providing exposition and will also play a part in <em>The Great

soul, Nicole seeks to collect all of the missing fragments of the
magical city, both on and off her home planet, soon coming into conflict

monkeys with crossbows, giants and even fairies.</p>
<p><em>Collector of Kurg</em> will bring Nicole’s adopted mother,
Cha’da, into the series, as Nicole encounters her sailing the wilds of
the world’s ocean.</p>
<p>This one is likely to be a collection of short, but connected tales,

<h2 id="baba-yaga-lives">Baba Yaga Lives!</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-BabaYagaLives.jpg" /></span> Baba Yaga started
out wanting to live a little longer, falling to the temptations of
necromancy to extend her life, gaining a mere decade or so with each
human soul she consumes. Eventually growing dissatisfied with such
meager fare, she turns her attention to consuming the souls of magical
creatures for the extra power they contain and her body slowly becomes
more magic than flesh, transforming her into a thaumavore.</p>
<p>However, with the rise of science and magical creatures of the galaxy
growing wise to her tricks, there’s precious little for her to eat. She
can’t afford the hefty price enchanted items sell for on the galactic
market and finds their weak magic unsatisfying, anyway, but she does
come across a rare and undervalued curio: one of the hexagonal coins
that make up the magical City of Kurg, an object so impossibly filled
with magic, it has the power to resist her every attempt to consume
it!</p>
<p>She seeks to unlock the hidden power of the coin, hoping to extend
her life until the end of time with its nearly limitless magic.
Unfortunately for her, not just anyone can access the magic of Kurg,
something only a city administrator can do. Learning this fact by
touching the mind of the coin, she seeks a conversation with Nicole, the
only available administrator.</p>
<p>Nicole’s quest to collect the missing pieces of the City of Kurg
brings her right to Baba Yaga’s doorstep and since their goals are
nothing alike and totally at odds, the meeting devolves into a magical
duel! War for ownership of the city follows, eventually leading to a
sprawling battle inside the legendary chicken-legged hut of Baba Yaga, a
magically-folded, mind-bending space that would give even M. C. Escher a
headache!</p>
<p>Will Nicole overcome the crone’s superior, time-tested spells or will
Nicole, as an extension of Kurg, become Baba Yaga’s living larder?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Baba Yaga Lives!</em> will bring legendary magical creatures to
the city, including Levi’s old familiar, Inorath, because Nicole will
need information on Baba Yaga and many of them are even older than the
ancient witch.</p>
<h2 id="the-great-purpose">The Great Purpose</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-TheGreatPurpose.jpg" /></span> In this volume of
<em>Jigsaw City</em>, the true purpose of Kurg is revealed: it was
designed as a powerful weapon for fighting a war that’s as old as the
universe. The Life Giver is back, in need of Nicole and her city’s
power, while the Life Giver’s nemesis, The Void, attempts to invade the
Milky Way, to begin consuming everyone and everything there.</p>
<p><em>The Great Purpose</em> will bring the Hunter from <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../ashen-blades/index.html">Ashen Blades</a> to the city, to
combat a nearly limitless supply of demons, because they’ve finally
succeeded in opening a stable portal to the galaxy. It will also involve
the Hunter’s arch-nemesis, Vogerath, since the portal was his plan.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

<h2 id="lost-city">Lost City</h2>

<p><span class="book-cover"><img

may have won the battle with demon-kind and The Void, but the cost is
extremely high: Nicole sacrifices her life for the success of their
crazy suicide mission and the Hunter finally reaches the limits of both
her demon and witch powers, with disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Nicole’s body is restored by automatic functions of the City of Kurg,
but her mind is shattered by re-birth as its living avatar. Lost,
confused and alone, will Nicole ever return to her home and those she
loves or will she forever wander a dying, parallel universe, seeking a
home she can’t even remember?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Hunter is also lost and alone, but in immediate peril.
She emerges from the spatial tear formed by The Void’s final kick at
thirty-thousand feet above a strange, alien planet, with absolutely no
idea where she is. Even worse, she’s lost the power of the elements and
been left to her own devices, totally unable to fly. Will she survive
the fall and find some way to get home or will she remain forever
lost?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="the-memory-hunt">The Memory Hunt</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>Nicole discovers the fact that her memories were backed up by the
city before she was killed, but unlike her body, it was unable to fully
restore her mind.</p>
<p>Seeking to regain a greater measure of humanity, Nicole goes back to
collecting lost fragments of the City of Kurg, mostly for the sake of
restoring her memories.</p>
<p>This takes her beyond the galaxy she knows, to far-flung areas of the
multiverse, because when the ancient city broke up, parts of it left the
galaxy, while some few traveled to parallel universes.</p>

the constant incursions of humans, the fairies long ago retreated from
Earth to an out of the way corner of the galaxy to live in peace, but
when humans accidentally stumble upon them, they aren’t happy and this
time, they’re not willing to give up their home without fighting until
either the extinction of themselves or the human invaders!</p>
<p>However, nothing’s as it seems, because the humans only arrived as
the result of a series of accidents, having been forced to make an
unsafe faster-than-light jump through space to the nearest potentially
habitable system, which resulted in the destruction of their star ship!
With nowhere else to go and faced with the hostile locals, they
staunchly defend themselves against constant fey assault.</p>
<p>Two soldiers on opposite sides, pixie Commander Stargazer Candleflash
and human Sergeant Edwin Harris, find their fates forever entwined,
first by hatred and the desire for revenge, but then, as they crash
together in a rainforest full of danger, they’re forced to work
together, just to survive.</p>
<p>Will these two rivals, who have every reason to hate each other,
survive or will their bickering get them killed? Is it possible a
fragile peace can be forged from their own personal cease-fire or will
the doomsday weapons held by both sides be released, ensuring the
destruction of everyone?</p>
