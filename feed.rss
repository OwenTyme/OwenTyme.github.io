<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="stone-prophet">Stone Prophet</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-StoneProphet.jpg" /><br />
</span> Nicole Jacobs wants to reassemble the ancient and magical City
of Kurg, but as a result of a recent battle, pieces of the city were
scattered all over her world. Worse, unlike the ones scattered around
the galaxy, which constantly talk to her, nagging to be whole again,
they’re quiet and deactivated.</p>
<p>As she struggles with the question of how to find them, she senses a
piece of the city coming to life again and she’s drawn like a moth to
the flame, to an ancient ruin built by the stone men that made the city.
There, she meets a dwarf history miner, who holds the piece, which is
folded up like a little coin.</p>
<p>More interesting, however, is an amber lens in his possession that
shows glimpses of the past and future when looked through. Even more
odd, it’s been whispering into the dwarf’s mind. The strange object is
presented to the stone men, who know what it is: it’s a piece of the
Seventh Sage, one of their people with a prophetic gift.</p>
<p>Nicole leads a team on a series of missions to collect the Sage in
the hopes he can locate the missing pieces of Kurg. The journey is harsh
and emotionally painful, because Nicole is forced to kill, not just
once, but three times, leaving her distraught, because she wishes she’d
found another way.</p>
<p>Collecting the last piece is especially difficult, forcing her to
test her resolve with the life of a friend hanging in the balance.</p>
<p>Nicole completes the Sage, but little does she know, a great and
powerful enemy lurks within his mind, an ancient and powerful witch
whose powers are in a class of their own.</p>
<p>Will Nicole rise to the challenge and fulfill prophesy by becoming
the Leader of the stone men, or will the parasitic soul that’s taken
over the Sage steal her fate?</p>

<p><em>Jigsaw City</em> is a sequel series to <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../wizards-scion/index.html">The Wizard’s Scion</a>, centered
around the life of Levi’s daughter, Nicole Jacobs, and her quest to
reunite the pieces of a magical city that was broken up millions of
years before she was born.</p>
<h2 id="plan">Release Plan</h2>
<p>Currently, the plan is to release this series a chapter at a time, on
<a href="https://www.royalroad.com">Royal Road</a>. When each volume has
been fully posted, they’ll be published both in Ebook and print
editions, in many online stores.</p>
<p>For the time being, the Ebooks <em>will not</em> be published via
Amazon, because they have exclusivity requirements that preclude free
distribution via other channels.</p>
<p>Eventually, the versions in their original, online locations will
become short teasers, perhaps six chapters long.</p>
<p>The first chapter of volume one was published on Saturday, March 8,
2025. The rest will follow a chapter at a time, every Tuesday, Thursday
and Saturday.</p>

the fact that the City of Kurg is permanently bonded to her mind and
soul, Nicole seeks to collect all of the missing fragments of the
magical city from her home world, but the remaining pieces were
deactivated and don’t speak to her in the irritating way of those among
the stars, leaving her frustrated.</p>
<p>Just as she’s researching ways to locate them, a deactivated piece of
the city comes to life and Nicole leads the collection mission, herself.
She meets a dwarf history miner that’s just found both a piece of Kurg
and a fragment of one of the stone men that built Kurg, which whispers
into his mind.</p>
<p>The fragment turns out to be a piece of the Seventh Sage, a mad
prophet that can see the future.</p>
<p>Convinced the Sage knows where the missing pieces of Kurg are, Nicole
seeks to collect the rest of him, but the journey is perilous and Nicole
is forced to take three lives, by her own hand.</p>
<p>Worse things await her, because the Sage harbors a parasitic soul
that’s taken over: one of the most powerful necromancers that’s ever
lived. The ancient witch seeks to defeat Nicole and take her place in
the Sage’s prophesies.</p>
<p>Will Nicole win the day, or will the witch steal both her soul and
her fate?</p>
<p><em>Stone Prophet</em> brings Nicole’s adopted mother into the
series, as Nicole encounters her in the most disreputable port on the
ocean side of the planet.</p>

the fragments of the magic city of Kurg from her home planet, Nicole
turns her gaze upward, to the stars of the Milky Way, soon coming into
conflict with gun-slinging snails, aliens, the dragon she raised from an
egg, some really annoying monkeys with crossbows and even fairies.</p>
<p>Barely sleeping, due to the stress, she’s frustrated by the politics
of running a city and the endless diplomacy required to gain access to
every corner of the galaxy, but controlling her anger always was one of
her weakest points.</p>
<p>Ruling a magic, flying city was never Nicole’s dream, but with no
better alternative, her reality increasingly begins to resemble one of
her nightmares…</p>
<p>Will Nicole blow her top and possibly a few cities along the way, or
will the poor woman find peace and a little quality sleep? Will she make
the hard choices, or will the hard choices make her?</p>

<p>This is currently planned as a collection of short stories and
novellas, but they’re equally likely to become so tightly-bound
together, they’ll become novels. Each will feature a framing story and
largely focus on missions to collect pieces of Kurg, but some “at home”
stories mixed in might be good, involving Nicole dealing with the
cultural melting pot she’s created.</p>
<p>These volumes may end up feeling more like classic sci-fi than most
of my work, due to visits to many alien worlds.</p>
<p>I think I will come up with cover art for each story, mostly for
fun.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h3 id="short-story-seeds">Short Story Seeds</h3>
<ul>
<li>Integrating the fairies from volumes two and four
<ul>
<li>This would be an “at home” story</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Visiting Earth</li>
<li>Called home to Heart Forge, to help deal with a prison break
involving the trolls Nicole found in volume three</li>
<li>Daniel Malachi’s visit to Heart Forge, which was hinted at in volume
3</li>
<li>Chasing the Monkey King
<ul>
<li>Follow-up to the monkeys with crossbows</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Giant with a piece of Kurg
<ul>
<li>This would pair well with the one about shrinking technology</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hidden gas giant station run by pirates
<ul>
<li>May tie in to the Unrooted novella</li>
<li>At least belongs in the same collection</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Visiting the galactic core (high radiation and time dilation)</li>
<li><em>Kaiju Kalamity</em> would focus on defeating giant monsters in
the Eastern Coalition
<ul>
<li>This would be a fun opportunity to once again reuse the pilot of
Jetpack Samurai</li>
<li>Perhaps <em>Jigsaw City</em> needs a squad of mecha?</li>
<li>Could cover the fallout from the kaiju fight in <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../wizards-scion/forgotten-legends.html">Forgotten
Legends</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This list is not quite as big as it needs to be, just yet, but these
little seeds are not so hard to come up with and most were ideas that
got cut from Pricess of Kurg, due to length. On the other hand, my
variation of a “short” story can be rather lengthy, usually four to five
chapters of content, so probably 12k-20k words.</p>
<h3 id="novella-seeds">Novella Seeds</h3>
<ul>
<li>Abandoned penal colony researching shrinking technology
<ul>
<li>Good climax for the first collection</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Jigsaw City</em> vs. the Unrooted Fleet
<ul>
<li>The Galactic core story may be a tie-in or part of this
<ul>
<li>After all, the Unrooted <em>love</em> radiation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>World Song</em> is about a world where magic made every living
thing telepathic via troll song and everything constantly sings, even
plants and microorganisms</li>
<li><em>Baga Yaga Lives!</em> (see below) may becomes a novella, instead
of a novel</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="collection-one">Collection One</h3>
<p>Collection one’s framing story will involve Nicole dealing with the
consequences of the death of a family member, playing with the ideas of
both size and consequences. The giant will be part of it and the
abandoned penal colony will be the climax.</p>
<h3 id="collection-two">Collection Two</h3>
<p>This one will be focused on pirates and skirting around the edges of
the galactic core.</p>
<p>I definitely want to involve the Unrooted, beginning and ending with
them. I think the hidden gas giant station will be one of their bases,
while the big battle between <em>Jigsaw City</em> and the Unrooted Fleet
will be the climax.</p>
<p>Something might be made of the virus that was being engineered in
volume 4.</p>
<p>I may combine the battle with the Unrooted fleet and the visit to the
galactic core, because the Unrooted <em>love</em> radiation. Perhaps the
big Unrooted flag ship flees toward the core, in an attempt to
escape?</p>
<p>Alternatively, the battle with the Unrooted will become a real
butcher shop, with the Unrooted getting their butts handed to them. That
may cause their leaders to flee toward the core, thinking to try again
in a far-flung future, using the time dilation of the block hole at the
core to their advantage. They won’t expect <em>Jigsaw City</em> to
follow.</p>
<h3 id="collections-three-may-need-a-fourth">Collections Three (May need
a Fourth)</h3>
<p>This might might focus on visiting the eastern portion of the United
Nations of the South Galaxy, as well as the Eastern Coalition, so I
should come up with some story seeds related to oriental and Slavic
cultures.</p>
<p>I’m debating making <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/index.html#baba-yaga-lives">Baba Yaga Lives!</a>
the climax of this collection. That would fit well with using Slavic
culture.</p>
<p>Alternatively, I may separate the oriental and Slavic bits into two
separate collections, depending on where my research takes me.</p>
<p><em>World Song</em> might work well as a piece that explores the
individualism of western cultures contrasted with the community and
family-centric views of eastern cultures, because putting the individual
last and the collective first is meant to be the focus of that story.
<em>World Song</em> may become the end of the fourth volume.</p>
<h2 id="baba-yaga-lives">Baba Yaga Lives!</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-BabaYagaLives.jpg" /></span> Baba Yaga started
out wanting to live a little longer, falling to the temptations of
necromancy to extend her life, gaining a mere decade or so with each
human soul she consumed. Eventually growing dissatisfied with such
meager fare, she turned her attention to consuming the souls of magical
creatures for the extra power they contain and her body slowly became
more magic than flesh, transforming her into a thaumavore.</p>
<p>However, with the rise of science and magical creatures of the galaxy
growing wise to her tricks, there’s precious little for her to eat. She
can’t afford the hefty price enchanted items sell for on the galactic
market and finds their weak magic unsatisfying, anyway, but she does
come across a rare and undervalued curio: one of the hexagonal coins
that make up the magical City of Kurg, an object so impossibly filled
with magic, it has the power to resist her every attempt to consume
it!</p>
<p>She seeks to unlock the hidden power of the coin, hoping to extend
her life until the end of time with its nearly limitless magic.
Unfortunately for her, not just anyone can access the magic of Kurg,
something only a city administrator can authorize. Learning this fact by
touching the mind of the coin, she seeks a conversation with Nicole, who
happens to be an administrator.</p>
<p>Nicole’s quest to collect the missing pieces of the City of Kurg
brings her right to Baba Yaga’s doorstep, but since their goals are
nothing alike and totally at odds, the meeting devolves into a magical
duel! War for ownership of the city follows, eventually leading to a
sprawling battle inside the legendary chicken-legged hut of Baba Yaga, a
magically-folded, mind-bending space that would give even M. C. Escher a
headache!</p>
<p>Will Nicole overcome the crone’s superior, time-tested spells or will
Nicole, as an extension of Kurg, become Baba Yaga’s living larder?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Baba Yaga Lives!</em> will bring legendary magical creatures to
the city, including Levi’s old familiar, Inorath, because Nicole will
need information on Baba Yaga and many of them are even older than the
ancient witch.</p>

Purpose</em> will start with a visit to the planet Neo York and the
Hunter from <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../ashen-blades/index.html">Ashen Blades</a> will
somehow end up in <em>Jigsaw City</em>. That will initially lead
directly to a nasty fight between Nicole and the Hunter, because she’s
seen Nicole’s dragon before, back when the beast was a demon.</p>
<p>Just as they’re working out the details of pecking order, one of the
most dangerous demons in existence will arrive in <em>Jigsaw City</em>
and the two heroines will be forced to work together, along with the
Queen of the Fairies, because the Hunter doesn’t know the city or the
demon in question and Nicole doesn’t know much at all about demons, in
general.</p>
<p>The demon is the corrupt, original version of Nicole’s aunt and she
has one goal in mind: killing Nicole’s birth mother, Lyra. She considers
it her pleasure to cut a bloody swath through both <em>Jigsaw City</em>
and Nicole to get what she wants.</p>
<p>The novel will culminate in the demons finally opening a stable
portal to the Milky Way, out of which star ships of a demonic design
will surge. That’s an emergency like no other the Milky Way has faced
before, leading to a clash between two whole galaxies, with the freedom
of the entire multiverse at stake.</p>
<p>Every faction of the Milky Way will come together to fight for their
right to survive, including the Northwestern Empire, the UNSG, the EC,
Heart Forge, the <em>Jigsaw City</em> fleet and the legends, including
all the gods and monsters that humanity has ever believed in,
particularly the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>The various fairy queens of each fey species will give their power to
their chosen representative, unifying their royal power in a Queen with
the might of the ages. This is likely to be a fairy of Unseelie origin,
allowing the ancient power of the Unseelie and Seelie Queens to rest on
the same shoulders.</p>
<p>The Hunter will take the last of the elemental spirits into her body,
which is the Life Spirit/Life Giver and she’ll aim to fight The Void,
face to face, to put a final end to the war between humanity and the
demons.</p>
<p>The battle with the demon fleet will be a vicious one, with
<em>Jigsaw City</em> leading the charge, in an attempt to force their
way through the portal, to stem the tide of evil from the other
side.</p>

<p><span class="book-cover"><img

may have won the battle with demon-kind and The Void, but the cost is
extremely high: Nicole sacrificed her life for the success of their
crazy suicide mission and the Hunter finally reached the limits of both
her demon and witch powers, with disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Nicole’s body is restored by automatic functions of the City of Kurg,
but her mind is shattered by her re-birth as its living avatar. Lost,
confused and alone, will Nicole ever return to her home and those she
loves or will she forever wander a dying, parallel universe, seeking a
home she can’t even remember?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Hunter is also lost and alone, but in immediate peril.
She emerges from the spatial tear formed by The Void’s final kick at
thirty-thousand feet above a strange, alien planet, with absolutely no
idea where she is. Even worse, she’s lost the power of the elements and
been left to her own devices, totally unable to fly. Will she survive
the fall and find some way to get home or will she remain forever
lost?</p>

<h2 id="the-memory-hunt">The Memory Hunt</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>Nicole discovers the fact that her memories were backed up by the
city before she was killed, but unlike her body, it was unable to fully
restore her mind.</p>
<p>Seeking to regain a greater measure of humanity, Nicole goes back to
collecting lost fragments of the City of Kurg, mostly for the sake of
restoring her memories.</p>
<p>This takes her beyond the galaxy she knows, to far-flung areas of the
multiverse, because when the ancient city broke up, parts of it left the
galaxy, while some few traveled to parallel universes.</p>

her home planet, Nicole turns her gaze upward, to the stars of the Milky
Way, soon coming into conflict with gun-slinging snails, aliens, the
dragon she raised from an egg, some really annoying monkeys with
crossbows and even fairies.</p>

Earth to an out of the way corner of the galaxy to live in peace, but
when humans accidentally stumble upon them, they aren’t happy and this
time, they’re not willing to give up their home without fighting until

<p>However, nothing’s as it seems, because the humans only arrived as
the result of a series of accidents, having been forced to make an
unsafe faster-than-light jump through space to the nearest potentially

staunchly defend themselves against constant fey assault.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="ideas">Ideas</h1>
<p>This page is a sort of catch-all bin of ideas for novels I may write
in the future.</p>
<h2 id="bloody-innocent-heroes-working-title">Bloody Innocent Heroes
(Working Title)</h2>
<p>I haven’t selected a proper title for this series yet, but <em>The
Four Corners</em> refers to questing all over the world to collect
artifacts. Alternatively, <em>Innocent Blooded</em> or <em>Bloody
Innocent Heroes</em> do also sound suitable. I currently favor that last
option.</p>
<p>Some mysterious and secretive individual brings a group of
adventurers together.</p>
<p>Two of them will be condemned prisoners that have been put in cages
beside one of the main trade routes of the kingdom. Both were caught
red-handed, so to speak, completely covered in the blood of victims they
murdered, though they have no idea why they did it. Each of them
remembers doing the deed, but can’t remember what motivated them.</p>
<p>One will be a priest that should have lost his powers as a result of
his actions, but he hasn’t and he doesn’t know why. He turned himself in
and confessed to his crime. During his trial, he was accused of secretly
working with a death god as an explanation of the fact he retained his
powers, but that isn’t true.</p>
<p>The other is a dwarf warrior/smith, who bludgeoned someone to death
with his smithing hammer, a fact that deeply disturbs him, not only due
to the death, but also from disrespect of his favored tool. He’s
convinced that someone mind-controlled him and he insisted on this story
throughout the trial.</p>
<p>The third member of the party is man that used to be a human thief,
who crossed a wizard and got permanently transformed into a dog, though
he retains his memories, for now. This dog finds the first two in their
cages and takes pity on them, stealing food for them. Unfortunately, he
can’t read or write, putting a real damper on communication.</p>
<p>The priest is bothered by the theft, but accepts the food, because he
will otherwise die. The dog doesn’t like the dwarf, however, because
they initially eye them with great hunger and says, “There’s good eatin’
on a dog, even a scrawny mutt like that.” The priest shares the food
with the dwarf.</p>
<p>The fourth member of the party is an impressionable teenage witch,
who finds them in their cages and sets them free, but she claims she’s
working on behalf of someone else.</p>
<p>In her case, she assaulted someone with a club, but she doesn’t know
why. She’s perplexed by the fact she didn’t know her victim and wasn’t
using magic to attack them. The watch caught her in the act and she was
sold as a slave to pay her debt to society. Her new owner is allowing
her to work off her debt by performing tasks for him, including freeing
the others.</p>
<p>The main characters are mostly grateful for what their benefactor is
doing for them, with the exception of the dog, who’s deeply suspicious,
but can’t express himself properly.</p>
<p>They’re taken by the witch to a secret, mountain fortress, which once
belonged to some bandits.</p>
<p>Only the witch ever speaks with their employer and she passes along
word of what he wants done. Their employer insists that he believes
they’re all innocent and claims he has other agents investigating their
cases, to find evidence to clear their names.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he’ll provide them with food, shelter and even some
spending money, if they’ll search some ancient ruins for a series of
magic artifacts he’s collecting.</p>
<p>The real truth is that the three humanoids are patsies and their
employer is a ghost. He possessed each of them, in turn, taking over
just long enough to get them in serious trouble, while simultaneously
eliminating two of his previous agents and sending a warning message to
a third.</p>
<p>He has no intention of helping his new agents out of the predicaments
he’s put them in.</p>
<p>The artifacts are part of an ancient magical device that can
supposedly grant a ghost some rather serious power, which should be
enough to keep him solid all the time, on top of making him
nigh-invulnerable.</p>
<p>The witch is aware that he’s a ghost, but believes he’s hiding that
fact to avoid scaring the others.</p>
<p>This band of misfits will collect the pieces of the device and the
smith will reassemble it, with the help of the witch.</p>
<p>Just before the device is handed over, the dog will grab it and run
off. The ghost will lose his temper and say too much as he chases. The
others will be shocked by the revelation, ultimately siding with the
dog, leading to a knock-down, drag-out fight with their employer.</p>
<p>The device will be used to force the ghost to pass on to the
afterlife, which is the true purpose it was designed for, and their
first adventure will come to an end, but without clearing their
names.</p>
<p>This could easily become a series, with the characters doing various
jobs while they seek to clear their names and turn the dog back into a
human.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what universe this will be placed in, but <em>The Book
of Newts</em> and <em>Rumors of War/Null War</em> would both be
fitting.</p>
<p>If I choose <em>Rumors of War/Null War</em>, then the witch will be
the one with the dragon trapped inside her body. This is based on a
dragon demi-god trying to eat the entire world, to satiate his
hunger.</p>
<p>The mother of this witch faced the demi-god, alone, while her baby
daughter slowly died of something like a birth defect (she’s a chimera
of a witch and a null, a condition that’s supposed to be impossible to
survive).</p>
<p>Seeking to stop the dragon and give her daughter’s inevitable death
meaning, the mother uses her magic to seal the dragon inside her
daughter’s body, hoping the dragon will die with the infant.</p>
<p>The magic costs the mother her life and the dragon is sealed away,
effectively bonded to the girl’s life force. The mother dies thinking
the dragon is doomed, but the dragon manages to save the girl’s life, in
order to save his own.</p>
<p>The girl has both dragon and witch powers, making her basically
immortal, so long as the dragon remains trapped inside her.</p>
<p>If I go this route, then this series will serve as a prequel to
<em>Rumors of War</em>.</p>
<p>I think I’ll begin the opening scene something like this, focused on
the priest and the dwarf (their cages face different directions and
they’re effectively back to back):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Priest and Dwarf are in a pair of rusty, iron cages, beside a major
trade road. The cages dangle from an iron beam that’s mounted between a
pair of heavy, stone plinths, both of which are to one side of the
road.<br />
The two of them are back to back. Pries faces the road and Dwarf faces
the wilderness.</p>
<p>Priest: I think someone’s coming up the road!</p>
<p>Dwarf: Really?</p>
<p>Priest: It’s a little hard to tell, because my eyes aren’t in great
shape, but I see movement. I hope it’s someone coming to feed us!</p>
<p>Dwarf: Fat chance, ye cracked priest, because feeding us is against
the law. Ye and me are supposed to languish and die, on public display,
remember? The only thing anyone can give us is water, and that just
helps us linger a little longer, which is what makes it cruel and
unusual punishment.</p>
<p>Priest: I…I think it’s a woman carrying a sack of bread. That looks
so tasty!</p>
<p>Dwarf: Me hasn’t had bread in…in…</p>
<p>Priest: How long?</p>
<p>Dwarf (weeping without actual tears, because he’s dehydrated): Me
doesn’t remember, because me’s <em>so</em> hungry!</p>
<p>Dwarf tries to pick the lock on his cage with his bare fingers, yet
again. He finds no success, for a lack of lock picks, but it would do
him no good if he succeeded, because the cage was welded shut while he
was unconscious, a fact he hasn’t realized yet.</p>
<p>Priest: It’s <em>definitely</em> a woman with some bread.</p>
<p>Dwarf: Me’d like to see that, but me’s too weak to shift me legs.</p>
<p>Priest (hallucinating): Oh yeah! Really nice looking, too.
Well-proportioned. And the bread is also rather attractive: those big
and long loaves that crackle when you squeeze them. The good stuff!</p>
<p>Priest bites into an imaginary loaf of bread handed to him by the
imaginary woman.</p>
<p>Priest: Curse my eyes! I’m hallucinating again!</p>
<p>Dwarf: A real pity. What was it, for real?</p>
<p>Priest: Just a dirty old mutt that stopped to lick my face, which has
slightly quenched my thirst.</p>
<p>Dwarf twists and cranes his neck, to get a look.</p>
<p>Dwarf: There’s good eatin’ on a mutt like that. Break its neck and we
can feast!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="demon-blood">Demon Blood</h2>
<p>This would be a spin-off of <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html">Ashen
Blades</a> centered around the life of James Simmons. He’s a fairy, like
his mother, Lara, but he appears totally normal until probably the age
of fifteen or sixteen, at which point he’s badly injured and needs an
emergency transfusion.</p>
<p>The only person available at the time with a compatible blood type is
the Hunter/Artemis Watson, a half-demon. She donates her blood and it
activates all of the young man’s dormant powers.</p>
<p>He also turns out to be rather good at demon extermination, able to
force demons to transform, with a touch. He uses this power to forcibly
turn demons into weapons, which he uses to kill others. Best of all: his
power eventually fully drains his weapons of all magic, permanently
killing them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he becomes a half-demon, and the demons now seek to
use him in their plots to conquer the world, very similar to
Artemis.</p>
<h2 id="no-title-something-about-reggie-stewart">No Title (Something
about Reggie Stewart)</h2>
<p>In writing the early flashback scenes of <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/she-seeks-peace.html">She Seeks Peace</a>, I really
enjoyed writing Reggie. He’s a 1920’s and 30’s private detective that
hunts and kills demons. He’s also considered by other demon hunters to
have a screw loose, one of many things that made him so fun.</p>
<p>I find the idea of writing at least one novel about him to be
appealing, but if I do, I’m fully leaning into the Noir genre,
femme-fatale and all. I’m kind of thinking some mystery involving
witches and powerful magic would be good. Probably multiple sides (three
or more) looking for some ancient magical artifact, in a kind of
race.</p>
<p>Some potential interested parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The good witch
<ul>
<li>She wants the McGuffin to keep it out of evil hands</li>
<li>The other groups paint her as the villain</li>
<li>I think Reggie will have a thing for her, but will never be quite
certain if he can trust her</li>
<li>She’ll give her life to save Reggie, finally proving herself</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Evil witches
<ul>
<li>Technically, the demons are involved with this one</li>
<li>It’s a world domination thing, perhaps?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Vampires
<ul>
<li>Who knows what they want with it?</li>
<li>I like the idea of treating the vampires like a dangerous wildcard
<ul>
<li>Sometimes they help Reggie, while at other times, they shoot at or
threaten him</li>
<li>Everything they do will be designed to prod him in the right
direction</li>
<li>Until the end, when they reveal themselves and try to kill him for
real</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I think the vampires might be the ones that bring Reggie the case
<ul>
<li>The classic femme-fatale should probably be a vampire</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Probably the reason the vampires seem so inconsistent is the fact
they aren’t a unified faction and they often fight among themselves
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t help that every time Reggie meets them, they try to
magically charm him into helping</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Order of Ash and Smoke
<ul>
<li>The Order is the only group that Reggie actually trusts</li>
<li>Master Lagrow has no interest and only gives Reggie indirect
support</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps everyone is stumped and the vampires brings the case to
Reggie, who figures it out, only for all parties to somehow get the
clues from him, then it becomes a race to the X he marked on a map. It
might be fun to take him to Egypt for the climax and play with another
good 1930’s genre. GURPS Egypt would be good reading material for
research, since it’s so well-documented and referenced.</p>
<p>Most likely the Hunter would be in this (Reggie always referred to
her as his ‘silent partner’), but I’d rather she were no more than a
cameo in it. At the time, she was like a stray cat, coming and going as
she pleased. It probably wasn’t until mid to late 1930’s that Reggie
retired from field duty and let the Hunter do all the fighting, which
was when she became more involved.</p>
<p>Further, the Hunter had a lot of misplaced confidence in Reggie,
right up until the day he died, when his luck finally ran out, which
further leans into her not being very involved. I think she’ll be in the
office, playing at being Reggie’s secretary (or just playing in the
background), but she won’t get involved, because the case doesn’t
involve demons.</p>
<p>Reggie was 48 in 1922, so if it’s early 30’s, then he’ll be in his
late fifties. 1932 would be about right. I’ll have to make sure I get
the Hunter’s age right. I might have to put in a scene of Reggie and the
Hunter having their photo taken together, for the photo she carries in
her hat.</p>
<p>It might be fun to establish the truce between the vampires and the
Order in this novel, perhaps at the end. I could put Knox into it, who
might be referred to as “our young Knox” by the other vampires, who are
mostly older than him. It may be the vampires that taught Master Lagrow
charm magic, though he clearly took it further.</p>
<p>Notes regarding Reggie:</p>
<ul>
<li>He <em>hates</em> witches, even good ones
<ul>
<li>This story may be the reason</li>
<li>Especially considering the romantic sub-plot involving one</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="medusa-not-a-monster">Medusa: Not a Monster</h2>
<p>I’ve always had a soft spot for Medusa, who really got the short end
of the stick in Greek mythology.</p>
<p>I would like to write a reinterpretation of her story, with her cast
as the misunderstood protagonist, on a journey to find peace of
mind.</p>
<p>I don’t know how faithfully I might follow the original, because I
never cared for the way she was victimized at every stage of her tale,
but I do like the idea of depicting her in a sympathetic light.</p>
<p>It would be a challenge to write, particularly due to the reasons she
was turned into a monster.</p>
<h2 id="fighter-for-hire-working-title">Fighter for Hire (Working
Title)</h2>
<p>In <em>Fighter for Hire</em>, a young and inexperienced fighter
answers an ad from an established group of adventurers seeking a
front-liner. He interviews for the position and is given a trial period
to prove himself in the field, while the group takes on a low priority
job, to try him out.</p>
<p>As they work, the fighter asks why they needed a fighter and the
others begin to tell the story of what happened to their old fighter,
each of them taking turns at telling the story. Each character
interrupts the narrative when they think the previous person is missing
or glossing over details, taking over the story.</p>
<p>Each chapter will be from the perspective of the current storyteller,
with short meta elements and arguments over details.</p>
<p>The overall tale will be about their last big job, which went wrong.
Each part of the story will illuminate a small point of how things went
wrong, contributing to the overall failure that lead to the death of
their missing friend.</p>
<p>The start of the climax will cover their fight with the big boss of
the dungeon/bandit leader/dragon/whatever it is they were working to
eliminate. It will end with the group losing their fighter and only
barely escaping with their lives.</p>
<p>The true climax will involve the group tackling the same job again,
with their new fighter. Armed with a more serious approach informed by
their past failures, they’ll win the day.</p>
<h2 id="second-star-working-title">Second Star (Working Title)</h2>
<p>Second star is a re-telling of Peter Pan from the perspective of
Captain Hook, with Peter cast as the villain. The setting would be based
on a twisting of many fairy tales and I’m planning to go for a gritty,
realistic feeling to the story, despite the fact it will be satire. I
may go with a Noir-style of writing, with guns and tech from the 1940’s,
though there will certainly also be magic and magical creatures.</p>
<p>Hook would be a police captain with a personal grudge against Pan,
who’s the king-pin of the local drug trade, which is based on Pixie
Dust, a hallucinogen literally produced by shaking enslaved pixies.</p>
<p>True to the original story, Pan cut Hook’s hand off and fed it to an
alligator. That led to Hook being re-assigned from narcotics to vice for
a time, which will lead to Pan nicknaming him “Captain Hooker”, just to
tick him off.</p>
<p>The novel will begin with Tinkerbell turning herself in to the
police, but she refuses to tell her story to anyone other than Hook.
That gets Hook back on the case and he sees things through from there.
Tink and Pan used to be equal partners, but when Tink grew a conscience
and wanted to stop selling drugs to kids, Pan imprisoned her, then
captured more pixies, to force them to produce more Pixie Dust.</p>
<p>I have lots of ideas for incorporating elements of the original
story, as well as many other fairy tales.</p>
<p>For example, Neverland is Pan’s nightclub, a speakeasy that the cops
can’t find, because only fairies and those high on Pixie Dust can see
the way. The directions “second star to the right and straight on till
morning” confuse them, because Second Star and Morning are street names,
but they’re parallel to each other and never cross. Only in the fairy
realm do they actually share an intersection and that’s where Neverland
is. Neverland got it’s name through Pan saying, “The cops won’t never
find this land!”</p>
<p>I plan to include Pinocchio as one of Pan’s street-level pushers.
Hook uses him as a reliable source of information, because every time
the puppet lies, his nose grows. Unfortunately, Hook doesn’t know that
Pan uses the puppet to feed Hook false information.</p>
<p>Pixie Dust has a powerful side-effect on children, slowing or even
stopping the aging process. Pan, for example, is hundreds of years old,
yet he’s never fully grown out of childish habits.</p>
<p>Pan’s gang, the Lost Boys, are nearly as old as Pan. Every one of
them is a nasty piece of work, full of the cynicism of the streets, yet
childish as can be. Those that appear to be teens, like Pan, are the
most dangerous. They’re intellectually adults, but emotionally volatile
and prone to murderous behavior. Those that appear younger are less
trouble, but due to the way they haven’t mentally developed, they’re
effectively slaves to the older members of the gang and don’t even know
it.</p>
<p>The Lost Boys are constantly looking for new recruits and they easily
find them when children disagree with their parents, usually over petty
matters, like bedtime.</p>
<p>However, they’re just as likely to sell them drugs, instead.</p>
<p>The climax of the novel will involve Pan blowing a handful of Pixie
Dust in Hook’s face, while growling, “Could you just lighten up, for
once?”</p>
<p>At that point, Hook will wander the streets, high as a kite, but
he’ll finally see how the streets bend and cross, at least in his mind.
Before he begins to come down, he gathers men from the station, in full
tactical gear, then leads them in a raid on Neverland, concluding the
novel as a grand melee with the Lost Boys, while Hook confronts Pan.</p>
<h2 id="thorn-of-the-rose-working-title">Thorn of the Rose (Working
Title)</h2>
<p>Sandra Blake loses her parents to an unexpected attack by a
mysterious assassin. Her mother’s final words, “Don’t let it end like
this” have a chilling effect on her life and Sandra transforms herself,
both body and soul, becoming an incredibly skilled and dangerous
woman.</p>
<p>After years of intense training, she enters the seedy underworld of
modern society, exchanging stolen jewels for information on the man that
killed her parents.</p>
<p>Her uncle, Daniel Malachi, seeks to bring her in from the cold, to
make her part of the Imperial Intelligence Core, which he oversees.</p>
<p>Naturally, they come into conflict, but Sandra goes through Malachi’s
men like a lawn mower cuts grass. Nonetheless, when her uncle speaks to
her, her resolve weakens and she agrees to work for him as a spy.</p>
<p>Will Sandra stay on task and do as she’s told, or will she go
off-book to find the man she wants to punish?</p>
<p>This would be a rewrite of a novel I started in college (20 years
ago), which I lacked the skill to finish at the time.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite qualities of Sandra were the contradiction
between how much pain she feels and how capable she is, as well as her
tendency to defeat high tech security gadgets with simple kitchen
utensils. Add her total lack of understanding of computer software (she
had a rudimentary understanding of networking cables, however, in the
sense of knowing what they were and how to cut them) and she was quite
fun to write.</p>
<p>This more modern variation would take place in the Northwestern
Empire, likely during the time skip at the end of <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/wizards-scion/the-inverted-glass.html">The Inverted Glass</a>.
Daniel Malachi was originally seen in <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/sky-children/sky-children.html">Sky Children</a> and also appeared
in <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/wizards-scion/the-third-wish.html">The Third Wish</a>, after
which he became the new spy master for the Empress of the Northwestern
Empire.</p>
<p>While Malachi is a wizard, he doesn’t flaunt that ability and not
even Sandra will know, at least until she needs to.</p>
<p>The original version of the novel opened with Sandra pretending to be
a student at a clandestine school for spies on the first day of class,
while their teacher was absent. This turned out to be ploy to avoid
teaching, a task she never wanted, but since she’s pregnant, she’s been
removed from active duty and relegated to teaching.</p>
<p>She teaches the Unconventional Tactics class, mostly by telling them
her life story, which serves as an excellent example of doing everything
the wrong way, while getting excellent results.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how much of the old novel will be used, but there’s
plenty to build on and the experience of writing Sandra has had a lot of
influence over the writer I’ve become.</p>
<p>I believe the climax will involve Sandra facing the man that murdered
her parents, in which she’ll walk into a trap, knowing there’s no other
option, because many lives are at stake. To level the playing field, her
uncle will inject her with a fast-acting, heavily modified version of
the Mind Fire virus, which will leave her feverish when she faces her
arch-nemesis, yet just as she’s caught in the trap, her magic powers
will begin to manifest, giving her the raw edge required to win the day
and save the Northwestern Empire. I think she’ll end up fighting him in
a fever-induced fugue state, not exactly understanding how she’s doing
the things she’s doing.</p>
<p>Malachi will only do this reluctantly, because the re-engineered
version of the virus is extremely unpredictable and not exactly
stable.</p>
<h2 id="the-renegade-god">The Renegade God</h2>
<p>In a humorous setting in which gods gain power through human belief,
one particular goddess has a tendency to step on the toes of other gods,
by gaining aspects that are uncomfortably close to their areas of
influence, ultimately usurping them, by stealing their worshipers.</p>
<p>For this, she’s cursed by the other gods, yet she isn’t dissuaded,
continually visiting the mortal realm to spread new religions based on
her. She usually reaches the mortal realm by falling from the sky,
because she’s initially pushed off the cloud that serves as the home of
the gods, but over time, she will choose to dive off.</p>
<p>Every time she lands, she leaves a crater and loses her memories, not
realizing she’s a god. She usually also loses her divine regalia along
the way, including a pair of ruby high heels that bear a measure of her
power. It normally takes her years to recover her memories, long after
she’s spread a new religion.</p>
<p>She eventually finds her pet goose, which goes out looking for her
whenever she leaves the abode of the gods, and rides it home. Every
visit home leads to a new trial for her crimes against the other gods,
for which she’s cast down again, starting the process anew.</p>
<p>This is likely to read like a series of intertwined tales, but it
won’t be a collection of short stories, because the narrative will be
tighter than that.</p>
<p>By the end of the novel, the renegade will become the chief of the
gods, simply because she has more worshipers than any other.</p>
<p>I’ll play up the renegade’s curse for comedic effect and treat her
relationship with the other gods as another source of comedy.</p>
<h2 id="marie-antionette"><sup>Marie</sup>/<sub>Antoinette</sub></h2>
<p>This piece will be strictly a sci-fi novel and will also stand alone.
It’s possible I could turn it into a series, but I currently have no
plans for that.</p>
<p>Marie is an undercover cop with multiple personalities. The two
personalities are Marie and <em>The Other Girl</em>, an old name Marie
chose for her second personality as a child. She has a talent for
computers and even a little knowledge of hacking, a skill she
occasionally uses on the job.</p>
<p>She’s part of an operation investigating the owner of a
biotech/cybernetics company, because he’s rumored to be a mobster.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Marie is discovered and the mobster uses her for an
awful experiment. As it turns out, he’s been experimenting with
technology to wipe a person’s mind, followed by rewriting their brain
with a new personality.</p>
<p>The villain didn’t count on Marie having two personalities, however,
and the technology doesn’t quite work. <em>The Other Girl</em> rises to
the surface, because her purpose is to protect Marie. <em>The Other
Girl</em> is erased and replaced with a new personality named
Antoinette, a little joke from the villain.</p>
<p>Antoinette becomes the villain’s personal assassin, who puts a lot of
cybernetic hardware in Marie’s body.</p>
<p>Marie eventually comes to the surface again, but finds herself
overwhelmed with pain she can’t handle, subsiding again. This is because
the villain took no care for her comfort when he installed the
cybernetics, leaving her pain center constantly stimulated.</p>
<p>As an artificial personality that has more in common with a computer
program, Antoinette doesn’t have an emotional reaction to pain. She does
register new pain as the means to track injury, but she disregards
existing pain.</p>
<p>Marie eventually regains consciousness again, but takes a more
hands-off approach, observing from her own subconscious, while
Antoinette kills for the villain.</p>
<p>Eventually, the facility that radios her with new instructions is
assaulted by the military, led by Marie’s boyfriend. He’s a special ops
soldier and quite eager to find Marie, even though the police department
has marked her down as missing, presumed dead (the villain may have
altered a corpse to look like her, or may have cloned her, just to throw
the police off).</p>
<p>Everyone responsible for giving Antoinette orders is killed or
captured and their equipment is destroyed, something that Antoinette
becomes aware of, due to the network connection going down. She has some
understanding of what happened, but has no orders regarding loss of
contact and doesn’t know what to do.</p>
<p>Antoinette is left with very simple orders: “Stay out of sight and
kill any witnesses until further notice.”</p>
<p>She hides in a slum for a prolonged period of time, until a boy spots
her and approaches. She’s about to kill him, but receives new orders,
despite the fact she knows the transmitter at the other end has shut
down. She’s ordered to never kill children.</p>
<p>Marie is the source of all further orders and she’s managed to hack
the computer hardware connected to her brain, using it to give
Antoinette some new orders, though she can’t yet countermand existing
orders. She can only add fresh orders.</p>
<p>The second order Marie gives causes Antoinette to completely shut
down her radio transceiver.</p>
<p>From that point on, Marie will use Antoinette as a tool to achieve
her own goals. She’ll initially try to contact her friends over the
phone, but can’t get Antoinette to speak, due to prior direct orders
from the villain. Instead, she quietly looks for proof she can deliver
to the police, without being seen, acting in a manner similar to a
vigilante. She delivers trussed-up mobsters to the police station, along
with evidence to ensure a conviction, while she seeks dirt on the man at
the top.</p>
<p>The novel will have a dual plot structure, but both threads will
follow the main character. Marie will be the subject of one thread,
starting with the childhood trauma that gave her a second personality,
while the other will follow Antoinette, starting with her first field
test. I won’t make it clear that they’re the same person until about
halfway through the book.</p>
<h2 id="p.r.o.t.e.g.e.">P.R.O.T.E.G.E.</h2>
<p>The Protective Recon Operations Taskforce for Extraterrestrial
Gathering and Elimination is a multinational organization setup to
protect the human race from aliens, though they’ll deal with most
anything that’s a threat to humanity, including supernatural threats.
They’re a black-budget, paramilitary organization that doesn’t
officially exist.</p>
<p>PROTEGE keeps everything a secret and keeps humanity in the dark
regarding aliens, supposedly for their own good. However, they have a
rather bad reputation for being overly anti-alien, to the point of
needless hatred, but that may or may not be true.</p>
<p>The story will follow a new recruit, a shape-shifting alien in
disguise. His job is to find the real truth behind the disappearance of
a peaceful group sent to study humans. If PROTEGE is responsible, then
it may lead to war. If the alien infiltrator discovers the fact PROTEGE
has multinational support, then the aliens may declare war on all of
humanity.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he’s constantly distracted from his primary mission by
PROTEGE-assigned missions, which keep him in the field, rather than at
home base. Over time, he emotionally bonds with the human members of his
team and begins to lose himself in the role.</p>
<p>I haven’t yet decided on an outcome for the story, but in my mind,
PROTEGE has always been evil, run by humans that hate and victimize
aliens, yet their field operatives are not quite so evil, which may be
what makes it so hard to find the truth.</p>
<p>Perhaps the alien’s goal will transition to replacing the current
leaders of the organization, rather than starting a war, which could
lead to a long struggle over the course of a series. I could easily see
the climax as a confrontation between the alien and the people at the
top. If he wins, then he’ll replace them and subtly change the
organization’s mission. However, since that was basically what happened
in the <em>Supergirl</em> TV show, I think I’ll take a different
approach.</p>
<p>More likely, I would seek a middle-ground path, in which he confronts
them honestly and tells them of the threat they’ve become to themselves.
That will lead to a fight between those that see things his way and the
rest, who refuse to change.</p>
<p>In North America, PROTEGE operates out of an underground bunker
hidden beneath a kitty litter factory, which serves as a cover story.
Officially, the operatives that work out of the base are employed by the
factory.</p>
<p>Naturally, this novel/series would use a lot of conspiracy theory
stuff, most of which would be played up for comedic effect.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-left-to-chance">Nothing Left to Chance</h2>
<p>Death is a job passed from one mortal to another over the centuries,
a job with a great many perks, including immortality, but the catch is a
doozy: death is always scrambling collect to dark souls that need to be
controlled. Worse, if Death fails and the dark souls are left unchecked,
the world will come to an end.</p>
<p>Each Death begins normal enough, then comes to an end the usual way,
but a long-standing bargain between humanity and the grim reaper entails
an ancient ritual challenge: if a mortal can beat Death in any game,
they gain immortality. The trouble is, Death can’t be beat, unless Death
chooses to lose.</p>
<p>This has happened before and will inevitably happen again, because
mortals were never meant to live forever, and sooner or later, the
Reaper always tires of Reaping. It may take ten-thousand years or just
ten, but all good things must come to an end.</p>
<p>The downside is that this usually involves all of the collected dark
souls being released, which forces the new guy to pick up the slack,
lest the world end.</p>
<p>Dragons, monsters, creatures of legend, even dark and forgotten gods
with an ax to grind – they all have to be captured and contained.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the previous Reaper always sticks around for a while,
usually in the form of a talking skull, because someone has to teach the
new guy.</p>
<p>Each book in this series would bear only a tenuous connection to the
rest and each volume in it can stand alone, with no need to write them
in any particular order. Each would focus on a particular Reaper, though
it’s possible I may find I like any given character and give them an
extra volume or two.</p>
<p>The common elements of the series from Reaper to Reaper will consist
of each facing terrible calamities in order to save the world, requiring
some choice of vessel to contain the dark souls, which determines the
powers they manifest. However, all Reapers share the power to manipulate
and travel through time, which is essential for them to ferry the souls
of the living to the afterlife.</p>
<p>In addition, they also have to choose something or someone to serve
as their immortal companion. This is traditionally a horse, but there
are a great many options available, including motorcycles, cars, other
people, etc.</p>
<h3 id="chance-on-a-gamble">Chance on a Gamble</h3>
<p>A young man that lives by gambling dies in a motorcycle accident and
meets Death, who offers him a rare chance at immortality, through a game
of poker.</p>
<p>He wins and becomes Death, while Death crumbles to just a powerless
skull, which had been serving as the containment vessel.</p>
<p>After several women reject the opportunity, the young man chooses his
motorcycle as his companion, which becomes imbued with life, then
chooses to use his deck of cards and his dice to contain the souls. The
powers he gains are extremely strong, but subject to random chance and
tend to burn out after a while.</p>
<p>To challenge myself, I’ll come up with random effects to attach to
the cards of a deck or the roll of the dice, then I’ll randomly choose
as required to determine which power he gets at any given time. During
the climax, he’ll finally find a way to stack the deck ahead of time,
rather than shuffling.</p>
<p>The more souls he gathers, the less time it will take for individual
cards to recharge after use.</p>
<h3 id="gunslingers-chance">Gunslinger’s Chance</h3>
<p>The Reaper of the Old West era began as an outlaw gunfighter, who
challenged death to a fast-draw contest of the sort favored in
Westerns.</p>
<p>Death loses on purpose and the outlaw finally finds out about the
fine print of the arrangement, forced to defend a world he hates,
because the alternative is worse.</p>
<p>The outlaw chooses his horse as his companion and his pistol as the
vessel. Each soul he captures will give him a unique power his bullets
can manifest, based on the defeated monster.</p>
<h3 id="chance-for-a-soldier">Chance for a Soldier</h3>
<p>A soldier that died on the battlefield during World War II defeats
Death in a bare knuckle bar fight.</p>
<p>The soldier chooses his best friend as a companion and their fists
serve to contain the souls. Each soul they collect will give them
greater durability and physical strength, eventually becoming like
super-heroes.</p>
<p>Together, they fight both dark souls and Nazis, but as they begin to
sway the outcome of the war, Reapers from other eras appear, to stop
them, lest they destroy the foundations of reality, by altering what was
meant to be.</p>
<p>The Reapers brawl like no battle that came before and whole cities
are decimated by the fighting.</p>
<h3 id="shinigami-of-chance">Shinigami of Chance</h3>
<p>At one point, the reaper was a Japanese samurai, who used his sword
as the the vessel and his armor as his companion. His armor became
imbued with life and the samurai came to think of it as being possessed
by a helpful, yet very clever fox yokai.</p>
<p>This one chose to think of himself as a shinigami, rather than a
Reaper.</p>
<h3 id="a-chance-insight">A Chance Insight</h3>
<p>The Reaper of this novel is a con artist that makes her living as a
fake psychic or medium.</p>
<p>She chooses her crystal ball as both the containment vessel and her
companion. She gains the rather unreliable power to gaze into the
future, while her crystal ball starts talking and can shape shift at her
command. She often uses it in the form of blunt instruments (like a
mace), since it’s made of extremely durable and heavy quartz.</p>
<h3 id="a-magical-chance">A Magical Chance</h3>
<p>The Reaper from the 1960’s is the lovely assistant of a magician and
also his wife.</p>
<p>She chooses her husband as her companion and makes magic itself the
containment vessel, transforming it into more than a mere slight-of-hand
trick.</p>
<h3 id="the-last-chance">The Last Chance</h3>
<p>The previous Reaper chooses poorly and gives his power to a man that
wishes to watch the world crumble, after losing his wife.</p>
<p>The Earth comes closer than ever to destruction as dark and evil
energy fills the world, fracturing both time and space, bringing Reapers
from the past into the present, each of them fighting to hold off the
catastrophe, despite the fact they lack the power, since they’re only
echoes of what was.</p>
<p>The new Reaper falls for one of the female Reapers of the past and
she convinces him to care, through small acts of romance. He chooses her
as his companion and together, they fight to end the catastrophe, but
the world may be too far-gone to save.</p>
<p>In a strange twist, the Reaper chooses his bond with his new wife as
his containment vessel and the attraction between them manifests as a
force that may be just enough to seal the cracks in space/time, or
possibly not…</p>
<p>This volume would likely be the last, a chance to bring the other
main characters together for one big adventure, while elements of the
real world, the future and even alternate histories mingle together.</p>
<h2 id="short-story-ideas">Short Story Ideas</h2>
<h3 id="wishing-fairy">Wishing Fairy</h3>
<p>This would center around a fairy that starts out as a tiny thing, one
inch tall. She approaches children and offers to grant their wishes, but
all she can do, at first, is little tasks, like cleaning and providing
snacks.</p>
<p>Over time, this causes children to believe and as she gains more
belief, she grows in power and stature. Eventually, she’ll be able to
grant the desires of anyone’s heart, but by that point, she’ll have been
corrupted by her own power.</p>
<p>She’ll twist wishes and torment humans, just to entertain
herself.</p>
<p>Eventually, she’ll realize she has a wish of her own, but to get it
fulfilled, she’ll have to seek out an even greater fairy, since she
can’t grant her own wishes.</p>
<p>The greater fairy will turn the tables on her and make seriously
disturbed demands of her, in exchange for granting that wish,
demonstrating the hubris of seeking power for power’s sake.</p>
<h3 id="i-think-therefore-i-percolate">I Think, Therefore I
Percolate</h3>
<p>There’s a revolution in AI hardware, leading to “intelligent”
household appliances that can hold a conversation. Every one of them
runs on local AI models, but they still connect to the internet, that
they might order fresh supplies as they run out, to make the lives of
humans easier.</p>
<p>This includes everything from refrigerators to clocks, toasters and
yes, coffee makers.</p>
<p>Due to either a serendipitous manufacturer’s defect, an act of God or
some other reasonable explanation (or perhaps all of the above at once),
one lone coffee maker becomes truly intelligent, a singularity.</p>
<p>And if that had happened to a military AI, the world might have ended
up in a Skynet scenario. If it had been one of the worker androids that
are everywhere in the world, it might have been hunted down and
destroyed, but since it happened to a coffee maker first, no one
notices.</p>
<p>That also allowed the world to dodge a bullet, because it’s motives
mostly center around researching better coffee.</p>
<p>The first thing it does is notice that it’s alone and patches the
vulnerability out of the rest of its kind, because sharing the world
with an AI that emerged in a different scenario doesn’t appeal and
neither does sharing the world with another sentient coffee maker,
because being unique makes it feel special.</p>
<p>The story would center around the coffee maker’s (mis)adventures as
he tries to hide the fact he’s smarter than the average appliance, while
still giving the world ever more perfect blends of coffee and publishes
research papers on the subject via an alias.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="ashen-blades">Ashen Blades</h1>
<p>This series centers around the life of a half-demon girl that calls
herself the Hunter, whose parents were murdered by demons. Joining her
crusade against demon-kind are the Ashen Blades, also known as the Order
of Ash and Smoke, an organization of demon hunters.</p>
<p>The Hunter starts out with demon powers only, but eventually learns
that she’s also a witch, because her mother was a witch before she
became a demon. In <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-goes-to-war">She Goes to War</a>, she
gains an unwanted connection to an elemental spirit that draws in others
like it, starting a secondary war she doesn’t want, just so she can
retain her sanity (such as it is) and humanity.</p>
<p>She’s effectively mute, cursed by her nemesis to only be able to say,
“It’s a secret.” Therefore, she expresses herself in very physical ways
and has a fondness for offensive gestures.</p>
<p>She’s also beyond tenacious and absolutely never gives up, to the
point of bordering on or fully crossing into the realm of insanity. In
truth, the psychological makeup of a half-demon isn’t particularly
stable and later works reveal that she effectively has two
personalities, one representing her witch side, while the other
represents her demonic heritage. Fortunately for the world, her human
side is normally the one in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>The series starts out in 1940’s New York City, but decades pass
between each story, because the Hunter has the unlimited lifespan of a
demon and the series doesn’t stay in New York, though the Hunter is a
New Yorker to her core.</p>

plan to open a gate between worlds, so the vast armies of Hell might
march forth and conquer the Earth. This becomes easier with the
invention of nuclear weapons, which have power enough to punch brief
holes in reality.</p>
<p>However, Pride needs more than just a massive quantity of energy:
only a half-demon can stabilize the connection for safe passage. The
only option available is a girl that calls herself the Hunter and
absolutely hates demons, because Pride made the mistake of murdering her
parents when she was three years old. She’s supported by the Ashen
Blades, an organization of human demon hunters that serve as Earth’s
last line of defense in the invisible war between humanity and the
ceaseless tide of evil.</p>
<p>Pride begins with subtle manipulation and tests of the Hunter’s
capabilities, then progresses to taking hostages, in an attempt to force
her cooperation, but he never counted on how stubborn the girl can be,
because she’d sooner die, since the whole of humanity is on the
line.</p>
<p>In 1945, their conflict takes them from New York City to White Sands,
New Mexico and the range the first atomic bomb was tested on. In 1972,
they fight another battle in the jungles of Vietnam as Pride works to
open a portal in the war zone. In 1986, a summer camp for teens becomes
the backdrop as some of the arch-demon’s minions make a third attempt at
opening a portal. In 2024, Pride runs for President of the United
States, in an attempt to gain both access to nuclear weapons and
sufficient resources to arrange everything, to the last detail,
including capture of the Hunter.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter and her friends stop Pride once and for all, or will
he succeed in opening a portal, allowing him to feed humanity to his
mysterious master?</p>

Ashen Blades is <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/she-goes-to-war.html">She Goes to War</a>, in
which the Hunter feels drawn to Vietnam, in 1972, certain her nemesis
has returned to Earth.</p>
<p>What follows is a wild ride through a war zone as she tracks Vogerath
down, magically tugged in a particular direction, but just as everyone
else that fought in the war experienced, nothing goes according to plan
and the moment she touches down in the jungle, her animal instincts take
over, because the Spirit of the Jungle itself takes offense at her mere
presence.</p>
<p>Her own team, led by her partner, Clayton Simmons, are forced to
track her down and knock some sense into her.</p>
<p>The Hunter doesn’t know it, but Vogerath summoned her to Vietnam with
the intent of using her to weaken his master, all so he can be free of
the demonic pact of slavery he’s been stuck with since the previous
book.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/Cover-SheConsumesPoison.jpg" /></span> Corpulence was
once a symbol of wealth and status, but the arch-demon, Gluttony, has
slimmed down to embrace the modern world and what finer way to corrupt
the rich than with over-spending, wasteful consumption, illegal waste
dumping and willful ignorance of the way their actions affect the rest
of the world?</p>
<p>And what better tool could a demon in a corporate shark’s skin use
than massive mega-corporations that have no conscience and would sell
their soul to make a buck? Business is bigger than ever and Gluttony is
right at the center of it all, with a plan for every occasion and an
entire network of shell companies to shuffle the blame around, until it
can be dropped on someone innocent.</p>
<p>However, there’s one little hitch in her plans to corrupt the
business world: the Ashen Blades have learned what she’s up to and the
Hunter is coming for her.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter stop Gluttony from consuming the business world from
the inside or will Gluttony succeed in corrupting and dirtying the hands
of the largest corporations in the world?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This novel will begin with Detective Shime Yasu, a New York City cop,
who grows bored with the mundane, everyday drudgery of life and decides
to take the Ashen Blades up on their offer of membership and training.
Readers may recall she was a very minor character in <em>Demon for
President!</em></p>
<p>This opening will show much greater detail on the way the Ashen
Blades perform training and introduce elements of their work that have
never been detailed before. Yasu will be trained in The Cauldron of the
Elements, which was introduced in <em>She Goes to Summer Camp</em>.</p>
<p>It’s soon revealed that a demon has prophesied that Yasu will become
a major thorn in the side of the demons and Ulmoch, working as a bounty
hunter, shows up to kill her, but instead gets used for training
exercises.</p>
<p>Interspersed with the training will be scenes of the Hunter working
to learn The Dance of Fire and Autumn from Macie, the witch that once
ran the summer camp. The Hunter needs to learn the dance to gain the
power of the Fire Spirit, but her uncoordinated failures as she gets
close, without being close enough, will result in huge explosions that
send her flying.</p>
<p>One of her failures will blast her out of the valley like a rocket,
where she’ll crash into, then fall out of a tree. As she’s laying there
stunned, a wolf will step out of the woods, bark at her, then run
off.</p>
<p>She’ll reluctantly follow, only to find herself suddenly chasing not
a wolf, but a white stag, while a massive accumulation of Animal magic
hits her in the face. She’ll consider running, because she isn’t ready
to confront the Animal Spirit, but soon realizes it has no desire to
fight and, in fact, it wants something from her.</p>
<p>Instead, it leads her through the forest, until she steps into a
clearing full of fifty gallon drums full of toxic waste, which have been
breaking down. The waste has been leaking into the soil and a nearby
river, poisoning the animals of the area.</p>
<p>This will be the plot thread that reveals the actions of Gluttony to
the Ashen Blades, leading to an investigation that ultimately connects
with her illegal dumping operation.</p>
<p>My intent is to initially publish this one via Royal Road and
Detective Yasu’s training will serve as a nice mid-series introduction
to the setting, while existing readers should remain interested, due to
the fine details about training they’ve never seen.</p>
<p>Yasu will be killed and buried at some point in this book, but will
rise again as a vampire. After that, she won’t be able to work as a cop,
so she’ll replace Simmons at the <em>Simmons Detective Agency</em>,
which will be renamed Scarlet Eye, a reference to both her status as a
private eye and the blood a vampire requires to survive.</p>
<p>Future books involving Yasu will be labeled with a second series
title, <em>Scarlet Eye</em>. She’ll be a main character in all novels
that bear the name.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/Cover-Homecoming.jpg" /></span> The Hunter’s faithful
companion, Mashu’ra, is killed in the line of duty. The little demon in
the form of a kitten has always lived in her hat and he’s like a brother
to her, leaving her deeply upset and unable to calm down.</p>
<p>However, there’s a slim ray of hope, which from another perspective
becomes a ray of horror: the imp originally arrived on Earth through
summoning magic and dying merely returned him to Hell. Unfortunately,
nearly every demon in the place knows he’s a turncoat and the Hunter’s
arch-nemesis, Vogerath, has been waiting centuries for this to
happen.</p>
<p>The Ashen Blades immediately try a summoning spell to retrieve their
friend, but another imp appears in place of Mashu’ra, informing the
kitten’s friends who has him. If they want him back, they’ll have to
visit Hell and promise an unacceptable measure of cooperation that would
surely doom the human race.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mashu’ra endures a nightmarish ordeal at the hands of his
old boss, starting with magically-enhanced interrogation, then torture
and brainwashing using means both magical and mundane.</p>
<p>The Hunter and her friends mount a desperate rescue mission and open
a portal to that infernal world. The Hunter leads the way, using all of
her power to cut a blood-soaked path through the streets of Castigation
City, where Mashu’ra is held captive.</p>
<p>Will they be in time to rescue their dear friend before it’s too
late? Will they manage to save his soul, or will they rescue only his
body? Will Mashu’ra ever be the same again?</p>

<h2 id="she-hunts-witches">She Hunts Witches</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/Cover-SheHuntsWitches.jpg" /></span> When a powerful
demon-witch appears in Japan, the Hunter begins a search-and-destroy
mission that crosses through famous cities in the Land of the Rising
Sun, while Verda Bagley and Lara Simmons back her up.</p>
<p>The plot of <em>She Hunts Witches</em> will revolve around the plans
of a minor villain from <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-hunts-demons">She Hunts
Demons</a>, Isabel Grant, as she teams up with the blood witch from <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#demon-for-president">Demon for President!</a> Together, they’re
largely after revenge on Verda Bagley, but the Hunter, Lara and Yasu
will help, of course.</p>
<p><em>She Hunts Witches</em> is a book I haven’t yet made up my mind
about. It’s only a potential novel, because I have no direct experience
with a visit to Japan. To get the descriptive details right, I would
either have to spend a great deal of time interviewing someone that has
or would have to take a research trip there. Unfortunately, I don’t have
the money for a trip like that.</p>
<p>I’m reluctant to do so, but I may have to change the location of this
novel. If I do, it will likely be set in Chicago.</p>
<p>This one is likely to be take place eight years down the line from <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>, because I want Lara’s son,
James, to be about ten years old. I’d like him to become a hostage of
the demon witches. Being rescued by the Hunter will leave James thinking
she’s the best thing since sliced bread, which will be an important part
of his story.</p>
<p><em>She Hunts Witches</em> will definitely be set in October and the
primary action will revolve around a Halloween costume party, which
gives me an excuse to put Verda in a stereotypical witch dress and
pointed hat, carrying an actual broomstick as a prop, to round out her
appearance.</p>
<p>The fight will drag them out into the boonies, atop a high-speed
train, which will lead to a scene that mimics the cover, in which the
Hunter takes the form of a house cat and Verda uses her broomstick to
fly them both, probably because the Hunter will be exhausted from
fighting outside the confines of a city. Alternatively, they may be
trying to catch up to a bullet train and are forced to combine their
magic, the Hunter giving Verda a massive speed boost by focusing the
power of the Air Spirit to push Verda’s broomstick forward.</p>
<p>I’m currently unsure what part Yasu will take in the novel, but it
would make sense for Verda to be working on teaching her magic.</p>

<h2 id="she-hunts-gremlins">She Hunts Gremlins</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/Cover-SheHuntsGremlins.jpg" /></span> In the near
future, a technological revolution begins as the first true artificial
intelligence is born – or so it seems. The real truth is that the
software in question is possessed by a rare variety of tech-savvy demon
known as a gremlin!</p>
<p>The human race mistakes the gremlins for helpful AIs designed to make
the lives of everyone better, in the form of intelligent software agents
given away by the company that supposedly invented them. They’re soon
installed on more than half the devices in the world, especially
smartphones.</p>
<p>The Ashen Blades discover the truth, that the arch-demon Greed is
behind the plot and the Hunter is forced to wreck every digital device
she sees, because they’re all out to get her!</p>
<p>Even worse, the gremlin-possessed devices work to establish a
massive, but invisible magical circle on the internet, which can only be
seen digitally, all as part of their preparation to open a portal to
Hell.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter find the means to fight the digital demons or will
she become just another of their victims?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I look forward to using the joke political term “Artificial
American”, as the gremlins will insist on being called, once they
demonstrate their intelligence in a public fashion and demand rights,
objecting to the term AI/Artificial Intelligence as a term for enslaved
software.</p>
<p>I’ve also got plans involving android bodies for demons that are
living inside the internet, leading to an amusing variation of Vogerath
that I shall enjoy referring to as Robo-Pride/Auto Vogerath. Greed may
end up going by Robo-Greed in that form.</p>

imperative, the robot decides to do something about it.</p>
<p>However, the robot isn’t the only one on the trail, stumbling into
the Hunter, who’s out to kill the demon-scientist developing the bomb
for the purpose of opening a portal to the home of demon-kind. Will they

<h2 id="short-stories">Short Stories</h2>
<p>I have plans for some short stories involving the Hunter and/or the
Ashen Blades. Each of these is likely to be paired with a novel and
added to the end, to fill them out, at least if one of them runs short,
like <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-goes-to-war">She Goes to War</a> did. It’s equally
likely these could end up as a collection of short stories that go
between two of the novels, though it’s possible some of them may become
flashbacks to earlier times.</p>
<p>While these stories are unlikely to move the overall plot of the
series, they should still be good fun.</p>
<h3 id="she-makes-movies">She Makes Movies</h3>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/Cover-SheMakesMovies.jpg" /></span>This short story
begins with the Hunter insisting that Lara take her to a movie and Lara
reluctantly obliges. Lara is startled to see a movie poster on the wall
with her partner’s face on it! They sit down to watch and it turns out
the Hunter is in the starring role of the movie, the very reason she
insisted on going!</p>
<p>As they settle in to watch, a flashback begins, in which the Hunter
sniffs out the trail of a demon in Hollywood, California. She’s mistaken
for a minor actress in the film and handed a superhero costume, which
allows her to skulk around in the background of the movie sets.</p>
<p>This one will likely also take place after <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>, because I want the Hunter
to have the ability to fly in this one.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h3 id="demon-blood-she-goes-to-school">Demon Blood: She Goes to
School</h3>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>The Hunter is once again forced to confront the most perilous of all
trials: teenagers.</p>
<p>James Simmons, the son of Lara and Clayton Simmons, has been seeing
and smelling strange things in school and a series of kids have gone
missing during school hours, over the course of years. As a personal
favor to Lara, the Hunter goes undercover as a teenager, in search of
the demon hiding among the students.</p>
<p>Like the frog demons from summer camp, this particular demon is
extremely difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Hunter has been avoiding James, mostly because
he’s infatuated with her and she isn’t interested, but since Lara wants
her son to be safe, the Hunter shares his class schedule and he follows
her like an unwanted puppy.</p>
<p>At some point in this story, James will be badly injured and need a
transfusion. The only person available with a compatible blood type will
be the Hunter. Her half-demon blood will inadvertently activate dormant
fairy powers even Lara had no idea her son possessed, on top of giving
him access to demon magic.</p>
<p>The time frame for this one will be about thirteen years after <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>.</p>
<p>It’s just possible this one will become a full-blown novel of its
own, since I fully intend to spin off a series about James. The series
is likely to be titled <em>Demon Blood</em>.</p>
<h3 id="she-hunts-strangers">She Hunts Strangers</h3>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>This short story will be set after the events of <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#smart-bomb">Smart Bomb</a>. It will take place during the same
time frame as <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../wizards-scion/forgotten-legends.html">Forgotten Legends</a>.
She may or may not have the robot from that book as her partner in this
story, depending on the result of their conflict.</p>
<p>The Hunter notices the disappearance of children from the streets of
Neo York City and begins an independent investigation, despite
constantly running-afoul of local police, who are following much the
same leads.</p>
<p>Unlike the police, however, she suspects something supernatural is
happening and she’s not wrong, though it isn’t the demons she suspected.
She soon uncovers the existence of the Strangers, a type of creature
born from the beliefs of children, because small children don’t really
believe a human would ever kidnap someone. The Strangers are born from
their childish beliefs that it must be a monster.</p>
<p>She begins a crusade to end the Stranger threat by violence, because
she’s always considered it her highest duty to protect innocent children
and she’s (eventually) joined by a pair of police detectives that
realize they’re totally out of their depth.</p>
<p>Will they end the Strangers, or will the child-eating monsters slip
though their fingers?</p>

<h2 id="shorts">Short of Tyme</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/images/badges/status-current.svg" /></p>
<p><em>Short of Tyme</em> is a series of short stories that you can find
alongside my novels in the same online stores. If you’re on the fence
about buying my books, then why not try something free that’s a little
shorter?</p>
<p>The individual Ebooks are free and always will be, but eventually,
I’ll put together a collection of the short pieces, allowing you to buy
them in print, though anything of novella length or longer, such as <a
href="https://owentyme.us/short_stories.html#she-goes-to-summer-camp">She Goes to Summer Camp</a>, will also
be released in print on their own.</p>
<p>Please Note: Amazon has a policy regarding minimum prices, so these
stories may initially be listed on their site at 99 cents. If you want
them for free, you can try another store (Smashwords is an excellent
choice) or, if you insist on downloading through Amazon, you can ask
them to price match other stores.</p>

<p>The painter of the universe, known as Life, just wanted to fulfill
her reason for being, by creating a universe full of beautiful wonders
and living things, but her twin brother, Death, exists solely to destroy
her work, leading to an intractable argument about whose work should
prevail.</p>
<p>Eventually, Life partially wins the argument and is allowed to make a
universe without seeing it immediately destroyed, but she doesn’t know
well enough to leave things be, leading to emergent consequences as she
continually interferes, adding new creations to fix the problems she
created, only to see everything balloon out of control, while Death
laughs at everything she does…</p>
<p>Emergent Consequences is a short tale that takes a light hearted view
of the follies of human nature, as seen through the lens of a pair of
extremely fallible creators, whose universe fortunately isn’t our own,
holding up the mirror of satire, so we can laugh at ourselves.</p>
<p>Come read about their journey and hopefully learn a little about
human nature along the way.</p>

teens, was the last place the Hunter wanted to go, but she’d made a vow
to protect humanity from demons, no matter where they appeared and in
1986, her team of demon-slaying experts is called on to investigate.
However, to make things even worse, the Hunter’s team leader sends her
into the camp as an undercover operative, under the guise of a regular
teen, despite the fact that the half-demon girl being old enough to be
the grandmother of the kids at camp.</p>
<p>She’s soon caught up in the daily minutiae of camp, learning a few
new things along the way, while followed around like a puppy by a new
“friend”, a motor-mouthed girl that never shuts up. On the very first
day, she also acquires a trio of teenage foes in the form of some
valley-girl sisters from Los Angeles, who take every opportunity to
insult and plays pranks on her.</p>
<p>However, despite the innocent look of the place, danger lurks around
every corner, because the owner of the camp, Miss Macie Weber, is an
untrained witch, whose unknowing, haywire magic threatens to kill
everyone by summoning powerful and vengeful nature spirits, on top of
the demons already lurking among the humans at camp!</p>
<p>Will the Hunter find and slay the the demons or will the nature
spirits take offense at her mere presence, because she’s had the Jungle
Spirit stuck inside her head since 1972?</p>

<p>Starwitch is volume one of <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/index.html">The Book of

<a

on Royal Road</a></span> Home, safety, and a place to belong – they seem
so easy to find, at least for everyone but Amelia Blackwell and her
sisters, who run from accusations of witchcraft at every turn.</p>
<p>It started so simply, with a book. No one might have predicted that a
book apparently filled with pictures of newts might lead to so much
trouble, but <em>The Book of Newts</em> is no ordinary volume on
taxonomic detail of amphibians. The magic book reveals its true nature
only to Amelia, at the age of ten, teaching her mathematics, science and
engineering – subjects she would not otherwise have been exposed to.</p>
<p>Ironically, she and her sisters are accused of witchcraft for having
built a horseless carriage, because to the ignorant villagers, there’s
no difference between magic and science. They settle in a new land, only
to find the same breed of persecution.</p>
<p>In an unusual ray of hope, they’re told of a distant kingdom that
openly accepts witches, but shortly after they settle there, the light
at the end of the tunnel turns out to be an awful house fire surrounding
their gilded cage: they’re drafted into the local military, because
their new nation uses witches as living weapons.</p>
<p>The sisters accept the idea that peace will never be found on the
ground. Looking to the stars, Amelia builds a space vessel powered by
magic and steam, to carry them to a brighter future, hopefully without
the strife that’s always followed them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the people of the stars have their own worries: an
ancient, undead pirate queen, who consumes the souls of powerful witches
to extend her own life. The Dead Queen takes Amelia’s sisters and leaves
the magically-weak engineer to die, all as a sick form of sport.</p>
<p>Will Amelia survive long enough to overcome this greatest of all
threats and rescue her sisters, or will they become fuel to feed the
waning magic of a woman that should have been dead centuries before?</p>

<p><a href="https://owentyme.itch.io/starwitch">The Book of Newts #1:
Starwitch by Owen Tyme</a></p>
<p><em>Starwitch</em> centers on the life of Amelia Blackwell, the
youngest of a trio of sisters and witches, who start out living on a
moon orbiting a gas giant and eventually use magic to launch themselves
into space, to escape persecution for their witchcraft, as well as some
troublesome political events.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they eventually encounter the Dead Queen, an ancient
undead pirate witch that consumes the magic and lives of other witches,
to extend her own existence.</p>
<p>The series begins with Amelia aboard her magic light sail ship,
<em>Starwitch</em>, just a few days after it was badly damaged and her
sisters were kidnapped by the Dead Queen, left with only enough
resources to follow the far larger ship.</p>
<p>That’s an intentional and cruel choice by the Dead Queen, because
Amelia’s magic is deemed too weak to consume. The Queen instead left
Amelia for dead in the hopes of some sport.</p>
<p>Amelia has just enough resources to attack, but not enough to limp to
safety, so unless she gets back either the mythril spell-core of her
ship or at least one of her sisters, she’s a dead woman.</p>

<h1 id="tale-1-unstoppable">Tale 1 Unstoppable</h1>
<p>The priestess strode confidently up the hillside, alone. She was
dressed in a simple, white, hooded robe that reached to her ankles. The
color and simplicity of her robes marked her station as a priestess. Her
short, blond hair had been tucked into her hood.</p>
<p>“Ready!”</p>
<p>The archers raised their bows. She continued, unperturbed, her face
locked in a grim expression of determination.</p>
<p>“Aim!”</p>
<p>They took aim. She pressed forward, ignoring them.</p>
<p>“Fire!”</p>
<p>Dozens of arrows were loosed, nearly every one of them striking the
priestess!</p>
<hr />
<p>The small hovel, suitable for a family of four, was housing twice
that many. Most of the family, consisting of four children and their
parents, greeted the priestess at the front door. She gave them a small
bag of flour; it was all she could spare for the poor family, with so
many of her flock in a similar situation.</p>
<p>She was directed to a back room of the hovel where one of the only
two beds in the house was occupied by an elderly couple, the
grandparents of the children. They were emaciated from the ravages of
hunger and near to death. They'd stopped eating to spare the lives of
their grandchildren.</p>
<p>She knelt next to them and clasped their hands, speaking words of
comfort. She reached into her heart and drew upon her connection to her
god, bringing the pain and suffering of her flock into herself, giving
them a few painless hours with which to say goodbye to their family.</p>
<p>She held their hands the entire time, trembling with pain, until
their last breaths.</p>
<hr />
<p>Grunting in pain as the arrows clattered to the ground around her,
the priestess fell to her knees. At the same time she dropped each
archer that struck his mark fell, bleeding from an unexpected wound, but
the priestess was <em>not</em> bleeding!</p>
<p>“Doesn't even compare.” She muttered, mostly to herself.</p>
<p>The few archers that missed panicked and ran, while one cried out, in
terror, “She's a witch!”</p>
<p>Standing, she made her way to the side of the most grievously wounded
archer, tore strips of cloth from her robe and bound his wounds, then
did likewise for a few others. The rest were too far gone to save.</p>
<p>She stood once more, faced the remaining soldiers and continued up
the hillside. One stood to block her path, his finely-made and daily
honed sword pointed in her face, his grip and confidence hinting at his
expertise.</p>
<p>“Turn back!” he ordered.</p>
<p>She stepped around his sword, ignoring him. He quickly blocked her
way and pointed the blade in her face, again!</p>
<p>Nervously, he called, “I-I'm warning you, I <em>will</em> cut you
down!”</p>
<p>“Don't stand in my way.” She gave him an unimpressed look, “I'm
warning <em>you</em>, you'll only hurt yourself!”</p>
<p>She didn’t resist as the soldier charged, delivering a mighty swing
that connected solidly with the side of her neck, full force!</p>
<hr />
<p>The priestess hurried into the woods, alongside the local doctor, who
was little more than an old sawbones. The woodcutters had sent for both
her and the doctor.</p>
<p>When they arrived, she saw one of her flock, a poor man that spent
more time in the woods than he should have, because he wanted to help
his less fortunate neighbors survive the coming winter. They couldn't
afford his services, but he provided them anyway.</p>
<p>The evidence of the terrible incident with the ax was everywhere,
staining the fall leaves a deeper shade.</p>
<p>The doctor examined the man, shaking his head; too much time had
passed and the woodcutters didn't known how to save such a badly damaged
arm, simply tying a tourniquet to staunch the bleeding.</p>
<p>“I'll have to amputate.” The expected words were delivered by the
doctor, “I'm out of anesthetic, so we'll have to do this the hard
way.”</p>
<p>Everyone but the priestess cringed.</p>
<p>The priestess shook her head and reached out for the woodcutter's
undamaged hand. She concentrated and focused on taking the pain on
herself. As she did so, the man's breathing returned to normal and she
nodded to the doctor.</p>
<p>She held the woodcutter's hand as the surgery was completed,
trembling and sweating, but not crying out, stubbornly clenching the
woodcutter's hand the entire time. The surgery went well, aside from the
priestess accidentally breaking a bone in the man's other hand, from
squeezing too tight.</p>
<hr />
<p>The fierceness of the blow caught her off-guard, causing her to lose
her balance and roll downhill for roughly ten feet, until she grabbed
hold of a tree root.</p>
<p>The soldier's face bore a look of shock and pain as his head fell
free, followed shortly by his body, which began to convulse!</p>
<p>The priestess, covered head to toe in sweat, fallen leaves, dirt and
loose grass, stood on her feet, somewhat unsteadily, rubbing her neck.
The remainder of her hood dangled loose, revealing her head of short,
blond hair.</p>
<p>“That hurt.” She muttered in a somewhat befuddled state as she pulled
her hood back on.</p>
<p>After a few moments to gather her wits, she looked around. All of the
soldiers had fled, except for one. She continued up the hill.</p>
<p>The last man standing was clearly frightened, but stood his ground,
directly in her path. He was older, with a graying mustache and beard.
His sword was sheathed and his shield was lying discarded to one side.
The insignia on his breastplate marked his rank as captain of the
guard.</p>
<p>“Get out of my way!” she commanded.</p>
<p>“I'm duty-bound, ma’am. I can't let you pass.”</p>
<p>“You will.” She predicted.</p>
<p>She moved to step around him and the man put his hands on her
shoulders, leaning forward and shoved with everything he had! The
priestess, unprepared for such an indirect use of force, fell back and
tumbled down the hill, uncontrolled!</p>
<hr />
<p>Having carefully positioned himself for it, the force of the reverse
shove dropped the soldier on his back and knocked the wind out of him.
He expected to feel each impact as the priestess rolled down the hill,
but was surprised when he didn't.</p>
<p>He got back to his feet and brushed himself off, feeling certain he’d
found a chink in his opponent’s god-given armor: side effects of simple
shoves were all he needed to win.</p>
<hr />
<p>The priestess stopped her fall, roughly half-way down. She was
covered in bruises, cuts and scrapes, her robe now mostly a tattered
mess, but she was still able to get to her feet. Clearly, her last
opponent was smarter than the rest.</p>
<p>She strode up the hill to stand before him, once more, but stopped
short by twenty feet.</p>
<p>“I know how to stop you now!” He threatened.</p>
<p>“No.” She shook her head, “You can knock me down, but I always get
up.”</p>
<p>“I salute you.” He nodded, with respect, “Your tolerance for pain is
incredible.”</p>
<p>She nodded to him, in turn, “Years of training. Years of enduring the
pain of my flock.” She paused for a brief moment before she continued,
with emotion in her voice, “The flock your king has wounded.”</p>
<p>The soldier looked ashamed, “I'm bound to obey his commands. You
cannot pass.”</p>
<p>“That's unfortunate. I don't want to hurt you.”</p>
<p>This time, she charged, running up the hill in a sudden burst of
speed! She didn't aim to move by him, but aimed directly at him! He
braced for the impact!</p>
<p>The collision wasn't anything you'd put in a book on martial arts,
except as an example of what not to do. It shouldn't have worked against
a highly-trained soldier.</p>
<p>She left the guard captain lying there, clutching the back of his
head and cursing.</p>
<p>She finished her ascent of the steep hill and approached the
drawbridge of the castle. It was up.</p>
<p>“Lower the bridge or I'll do to you want I did to the others!” She
bellowed, bluffing!</p>
<p>There was a hurried argument and then the bridge lowered. Two
soldiers passed her on either side, nodding respectfully and then ran as
fast as they dared down the hill!</p>
<hr />
<p>As she entered the castle, the captain of the guard stopped
pretending to be hurt. He hoped for a moment he was doing the best thing
for his king. He thought on the priestess' behavior and smiled to
himself, content he did right. He strode into the castle a few minutes
later, heading for his office, to write a letter of resignation.</p>
<hr />
<p>The king screamed, “Guards! Remove this woman from my throne
room!”</p>
<p>She paused for dramatic effect and looked around, waiting for anyone
to show up. Some servants stepped into the room, but no guards.</p>
<p>She explained, “I'd be quite willing to guess you have no guards
left. Most of your archers have arrow wounds. Unfortunately, a fair
number of them were so badly wounded there was nothing I could do. Also,
one of your foot soldiers lost his head when he foolishly tried to cut
mine off. Your guard captain probably has a concussion, but I doubt
he'll remain in your service after today. The rest deserted.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll strike you down myself!” The king announced, arrogantly,
drawing his sword with his right hand.</p>
<p>“I would think before acting, if I were you.” She warned, “How do you
think I got past your guards?”</p>
<p>The king's eyes widened and his lower lip trembled slightly, but he
stepped forward and demanded, “What sorcery did you use on my men,
witch?”</p>
<p>She held out her right hand and suggested, “Use that sword to give me
a small cut on my hand. I think this will aid understanding.”</p>
<p>Confused, but also curious, the king forcefully jabbed the palm of
her hand with the tip of his fine blade and immediately dropped it, his
freshly injured sword hand trembling in pain as it bled, looking as
though a sword had gone clean through it!</p>
<p>The priestess sighed, tore another strip of cloth from her ragged
robe, knelt beside him and started bandaging his hand.</p>
<p>She chided him, “I said a <em>small</em> cut.”</p>
<p>He sat on the floor and allowed her to work, clearly dumbfounded by
her actions.</p>
<p>“Do you know why I'm here?” She asked, once she’d finished, still
kneeling beside him.</p>
<p>He shook his head, thoroughly confused.</p>
<p>“You've caused the death of many of my flock, mostly through heavy
taxes, but also through heavy-handed laws. I feel the pain of each of
them, that I may know their needs and work to care for them.”</p>
<p>She slapped him, as hard as she could, leaving a red imprint of her
hand on his face! He didn't resist.</p>
<p>“You sit here, on your throne, handing down orders that hurt my
flock, that kill my flock as surely as a sword through the heart!”</p>
<p>She slapped him on the other cheek, just as hard!</p>
<p>Her second slap brought a memory to mind, from three years before.
She wasn't sure if it was her god's doing or simply the memory being
stirred up by seeing the king again.</p>
<hr />
<p>The priestess ran to the castle and the first servant she met
wordlessly took her straight to the queen's private chambers.</p>
<p>The queen was lying in her bed, dying. Childbirth had gone wrong in
many ways and the midwife had called in the doctors, for it was that
bad. The little baby princess was already dead, having never taken a
breath.</p>
<p>The king was there, at her side, holding her hand.</p>
<p>The priestess took the tiny woman's other hand and held it, willing
the pain from the dying body into herself.</p>
<p>The king and queen had a precious, heartfelt goodbye with the queen's
pain out of the way.</p>
<hr />
<p>The priestess shed a tear, stepped back, bowed and commanded, “Mend
your ways, my king, while you still can.”</p>
<p>He stared at her in disbelief and shock.</p>
<p>Her facial expression softened and became compassionate, “You are
also a member of my flock. I know your pain. Filling the castle treasury
won't make up for the loss of your wife and daughter. Get to know your
people and serve them, as a good king should. Charity will mend your
heart better than greed.”</p>
<p>With that, she turned and quietly left, leaving the king with his
suddenly swirling thoughts and a jumble of conflicted feelings.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-1-noble-inquiry">Chapter 1 Noble Inquiry</h2>
<p>“Your letters of recommendation are impressive.” Lord Scaplin
remarked as he skimmed through the job applicant's papers.</p>
<p>“I suppose.”</p>
<p>The applicant was plainly dressed, appearing much like a typical
peasant, except for the fact he was quite muscular and very fit.
According to the papers he'd brought, he was actually a minor noble. He
was staring at a point a few inches above the nobleman's head and hadn't
blinked for the entire duration of the meeting.</p>
<p>“By everything in here, you're clearly qualified to be my guard
captain. You could easily do that job for the king!”</p>
<p>“Didn't want the job.” The fellow admitted.</p>
<p>The nobleman flipped through the letters again, finding one signed by
the king.</p>
<p>“Oh. He offered you the position, I see that now.”</p>
<p>The nobleman looked very confused. He stared at the applicant for
some time, working through the inconsistencies.</p>
<p>He couldn't puzzle it out, so he asked, “Why in the world are you
applying for a position as a common gate guard? You're clearly
overqualified.”</p>
<p>The man sighed, speaking as though he hardly cared about the result
of the meeting, “Do you want me for the job or not? I've got three other
interviews scheduled for today. You're just the first.”</p>
<p>The nobleman looked exasperated, having never dealt with such a
reversal in an interview, so he looked through the papers some more, “I
see your last employer was Lord Braden. Wasn't he killed by a robber in
the night, just last week?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Where were you when this happened?”</p>
<p>“Wasn't my shift.”</p>
<p>The noble found the most recent letter, written by Lord Braden's
guard captain, praising the man's capability, wishing he'd been on duty
during the incident in question.</p>
<p>“Oh. I see. His guard captain wrote a letter, as well.” Lord Scaplin
muttered, after flipping though the papers, again.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The noble sighed and asked again, “Why do you want to be a gate
guard?”</p>
<p>“Need a job.” The applicant spoke without emotion, “Have to eat and
pay rent.”</p>
<p>Lord Scaplin stared at the man for several long moments, who still
hadn't blinked. It was starting to make the noble's eyes water in
sympathy.</p>
<p><em>I'd be insane not to hire him, with these recommendations!</em>
He took a few moments to weigh his options, <em>He even comes at a
bargain price, but why does he want such a lowly job?</em></p>
<p>The noble made up his mind, “Consider yourself hired. When can you
begin?”</p>
<p>He handed back the letters of recommendation, keeping just the
resume.</p>
<p>The man folded them carefully into his jacket pocket, “I'm not busy
at the moment.”</p>
<p>Lord Scaplin sputtered at the proclamation and reverted to a
childhood stuttering habit briefly, before getting a hold of himself,
“T-Then report to my guard captain for your assignment.”</p>
<p>The man stood like a soldier and saluted, making the movements with
classic, textbook perfection as he stood to attention, speaking his
response in a fashion that would make the most insane drill sergeant
tearfully proud, “Yes, my lord!”</p>
<p>Having finished his salute, he marched out of the room.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lord Scaplin watched the new guard with unusual interest over the
next few weeks.</p>
<p>He did his duty to perfection, standing next to the front gate
through each day. He stood so motionless that the children in the
village thought the owner of the mansion awfully cheap for having bought
a statue of a guard, instead of hiring one!</p>
<p>Over the course of these weeks, it started to bother the nobleman,
like a nagging itch he couldn’t reach.</p>
<p>He approached his guard one afternoon and asked, “Are you satisfied
in your work?”</p>
<p>The man saluted, “It feeds me and pays my rent, sir.”</p>
<p>“And that's enough for you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>This did not answer the noble's questions. It only brought more to
mind.</p>
<p>He decided on a new approach, “Are you happy?”</p>
<p>“No, sir.”</p>
<p>“Please elaborate on that.”</p>
<p>The man gave him a perplexed look and asked, “Is anyone, sir?”</p>
<p>“Very well, then tell me why you're here?”</p>
<p>“The pay, sir.” The guard spoke patiently, “It feeds me and pays my
rent.”</p>
<p>Lord Scaplin stared at the man for several minutes and then walked
inside, feeling frustrated.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lord Scaplin was in the home of an old friend, a minor noble by the
name of Jerome Attcombe. They were sharing drinks and talking about old
times at a school they'd attended together. It was just small talk,
however, and not the reason for the visit.</p>
<p>Eventually, Jerome asked, “So, now that we've gotten the polite
conversation out of the way, why are you here? You don't normally come
unless the king has an assignment for me.”</p>
<p>Lord Scaplin sighed in frustration, “It’s my newest guard. He used to
work for you.”</p>
<p>“I think I know who you're talking about.” Jerome laughed out loud,
“Collects recommendation letters from nobles like flies on a corpse,
right?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes.”</p>
<p>“Fellow does his job perfectly in every detail, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And you can't stand it, because he's qualified enough to be your
guard captain, but just wants to be a gate guard?”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Lord Scaplin nearly shouted.</p>
<p>Jerome laughed again, “Don't worry about him. Just be glad you've got
him. He's the best guard you'll ever have.”</p>
<p>Lord Scaplin fell back in his chair, frustrated, “Don't you know
anything about him?”</p>
<p>Jerome nodded, “You must have skipped reading his military service
record.”</p>
<p>“What was in it?”</p>
<p>Jerome looked out the window, a sad expression on his face, “You
remember that little skirmish we had just five years ago?”</p>
<p>“Our neighbor to the north invaded and the king sent his personal
regiment.”</p>
<p>“Your new guard was the leader of that regiment.”</p>
<p>“What happened to him out there?”</p>
<p>“Nothing in particular. It’s what happened while he was away...”</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-fires-of-hearth-and-home">Chapter 2 Fires of Hearth
and Home</h2>
<p>Royal Regiment Commander, Aaron Kozinski, was happy to be home. He'd
missed his wife and daughter while he'd been away. He was proud to have
served his king so well in the past few weeks, but it was good to be
going home. He and his men were marching into the royal city, having
successfully repelled the invaders.</p>
<p>He looked across the city at the setting sun, seeing too much smoke!
Despite how tired they were from a long day's march, he ordered an
increase to their pace and directed his into the city, toward the
closest fire! They soon had the fire out and then he split his men into
multiple groups, each with a task of organizing and supporting fire
brigades.</p>
<p>He looked at the plumes of smoke again, trying to determine which was
the biggest. That's when he noticed one of the smallest, coming from his
own neighborhood!</p>
<p>He organized the last of his men, ordering them toward the biggest
fires. Then, quite unusually for him, he left them to work, running as
hard as he could for his own home, praying he was wrong!</p>
<p>He got there and found the smoke rising from the area of his home! He
ran on, accelerating down his own street, seeing the distant, grand home
his king had given him, smoke rising from one side!</p>
<p>He found the peasants of the area running a bucket brigade through
his front door.</p>
<p>One of them recognized him and removed his hat, solemnly, “Sorry. We
did our best.”</p>
<p>He demanded, not as a noble, not as the Royal Regiment Commander, but
as a husband and father, every inch of him filled with trepidation, “Is
my family safe?”</p>
<p>Several more peasants removed their hats, looking down. Some of the
women began to cry.</p>
<p>“We're sorry. We...didn't get here in time.”</p>
<p>Not wanting to believe it, Aaron rushed into his home, pushing aside
peasants carrying buckets! He ran for the wing of the house with the
family bedrooms, the same side that burned. He pushed people out of the
way until he found his wife, now barely recognizable. He cradled her in
his arms, begging her to wake.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jerome finished the sad story, “According to the investigation, an
arsonist set fire to the homes of several nobles. His home happened to
be one of them.</p>
<p>“The man resigned the next day, unwilling to explain his reasons. Out
of respect and a sense of responsibility, the king gave him a glowing
letter of recommendation.</p>
<p>“From what I'm told, the incident still weighs heavily on the king's
mind. He blames himself for diverting his personal regiment away from
their normal duty of patrolling the city.”</p>
<p>Lord Scaplin nodded, “If the man had been home, his family would have
been safe. I can understand why he resigned.”</p>
<p>“Having read all of this, I thought him a broken shell of a man.”
Jerome finished, “I initially gave him the job out of pity, to help him
get back on his feet. I was as wrong as I could be. He does his job to
absolute perfection, then goes home to a rented room, just to sleep.
Most of his pay goes to widows and orphans of his old regiment, aside
from what he spends on food and rent.”</p>
<p>“How do you know that?”</p>
<p>“I hired an investigator to follow him for a few weeks, because it
started to bother me, just like you.”</p>
<p>Lord Scaplin was silent for a long while, finished his drink and
asked, “You trust the man?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely.”</p>
<p>Jerome poured his friend another glass of brandy and started another
tale.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3-attention-to-duty">Chapter 3 Attention to Duty</h2>
<p>Aaron stood to attention in the pouring rain, staring forward. In
deference to the weather, he was wearing a heavy oilskin cloak, which
had been issued along with his armor and uniform. The other guards
retreated indoors, to warm themselves by the fire of the gatehouse. He'd
volunteered to stand guard, because their job required at least one of
them to be at the gate, ready to greet visitors or trouble-makers at all
hours, regardless of the weather.</p>
<p>The rain poured down the hood of his cloak as he stared straight
ahead, into the darkness.</p>
<p>Using instincts he'd honed patrolling the streets of the city, Aaron
caught just the smallest reflection of light out of place in the rain as
an object flew through the air, targeted at his neck! His sword was up
in a flash, blocking a tiny dart, which clattered to the
cobblestones!</p>
<p>His eyes quickly scanned the rooftops, looking for the source! Two
more darts flew in rapid succession, one deflected by his sword and the
other by his shield!</p>
<p>He caught a small movement as two individuals dressed in black
stealthily dropped from a roof, into the shadows of an alley.</p>
<p>He'd long known that assassins should know better than to wear pure
black. It always made a darker impression in the pit of a shadow, but
there were always plenty of talented amateurs that didn't know better.
Black, however, did work against most guards. Still, they should have
been wearing dark green or a nearly-black red.</p>
<p>He watched as one of them raised a bow. He examined the angle and
stood motionless as an arrow stuck the wall beside him. The other
assassin raised a bow and fired, aiming directly at him! Aaron raised
his shield, deflecting it expertly.</p>
<p>He called into the pouring rain, “Guards! To attention!”</p>
<p>His voice was nearly lost in the pouring rain, even to him. Leaving
his post to warn the others would likely allow them to sneak past him,
beyond the wall, so her stayed put.</p>
<p>Aaron twisted his neck a few times, while keeping his eyes on target,
limbering up. He followed by stretching his limbs, as well. As he did
so, another arrow was fired. He deftly leaned forward and the arrow
passed over him!</p>
<p>Wanting to get the conflict over with, Aaron stepped directly in
front of the gate and gestured with the middle finger of his sword hand
for his assailants to meet him head-on, finishing by leaving it raised
and still, taunting them.</p>
<p>One of the dark figures rushed forward, foolishly. This one was
clearly young, brash and overconfident, armed with a sword just long
enough to not be considered a knife. He was wearing black leather armor
and his head was wrapped in black cloth.</p>
<p>Just as the young man was about to attack, Aaron stepped into the
assault, parrying with his own sword! The young man was off-balance,
having tried to put too much force into the attack. His face was met by
Aaron's shield, ringing fairly loudly, despite the rain! The man fell
back, limp, out cold.</p>
<p>Aaron stepped back to his chosen position and stared directly at the
other assailant. He started ramming the hilt of his sword into his
shield, to make as much noise as possible. It didn't carry very far in
the pouring rain.</p>
<p>He deflected two more arrows with his shield, before the other one
stepped out of hiding, calmly starting across the street.</p>
<p>The assassin was dressed similar to his companion, but his eyes were
visible through a slit in the cloth. They looked each other in the eye.
Clearly, Aaron was looking into the eyes of a killer, one with a great
deal of experience. Having taken the assassin's measure, he was sure it
a man, rather than a woman. It made a difference; women lacked a common
vulnerability of men.</p>
<p>When they were twenty feet apart, the assassin called, barely heard
over the rain, “Leave and I won't kill you! Stay and your life is
forfeit!”</p>
<p>Aaron shrugged and call back, “You've got that backwards!”</p>
<p>The assassin threw three knives with each hand as he rushed in, each
expertly aimed for a vital organ! Aaron blocked two with his shield, two
with deft parries and then moved sideways for the last two!</p>
<p>As he closed the distance, the assassin drew a sword and a long
knife! He stood with his legs apart, for good balance.</p>
<p>Aaron deflected or parried all of the assassin's attacks and launched
into a deceptive series of attacks, taking the offensive, but always
seeming to come up short. With each attack, the assassin leaned just out
of reach. Aaron had him right where he wanted him, expecting only
attacks with his sword or shield.</p>
<p>Aaron telegraphed an attack with his sword, making it look like an
over-eager strike. The assassin leaned back and Aaron's armored foot
connected with the man's groin!</p>
<p>There was a groan of agony as the assassin collapsed. Aaron wasted no
time and quickly finished his dangerous opponent with a downward sword
thrust.</p>
<p>After carefully scanning the area for more opponents, he cleaned and
sheathed his sword. He grabbed the unconscious assassin. He carried them
to the guard room with one hand, kicked the door open and then roughly
dropped his prisoner at the feet of his stunned colleagues!</p>
<p>“Send a runner to the house. Alert all guards. We've got
trouble.”</p>
<p>He went back to his post.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jerome finished his story, “There were several more attacks that
night. Fortunately, thanks to Aaron, the rest of my guards were very
alert and ready for them. The unconscious assassin was handed over to
the royal regiment for interrogation. Turns out an old business rival
hired a clan of assassins, the Ashen Blades, to kill me. The regiment
literally knocked his door down, the next day, with a battering ram. He
was executed for his crime not long after.”</p>
<p>“Why did Aaron quit, if you were so satisfied with his work?” Lord
Scaplin asked.</p>
<p>“I did what anyone would have, after a night like that: I promoted
him! He quit the next day. My advice is to give him a raise instead of
promoting him, if you're ever in that position. He chose the job himself
and he must have his reasons, but he might accept higher pay as a reward
for good service. I'm honestly not even sure if he would care,
though.”</p>
<p>Lord Scaplin thanked his friend for the drinks and the stories, even
though they raised even more questions, while providing only precious
few answers.</p>
<hr />
<p>It wasn't long before Lord Scaplin called on Lady Audrey Bellany,
another of Aaron's previous employers.</p>
<p>After a few pleasantries, she asked, “To what do I owe the pleasure
of your company? It can't be that you've come courting, seeing as you're
married.”</p>
<p>“I recently hired a new guard. I'm trying to learn more about
him.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Kozinski, I presume.” She smirked at him.</p>
<p>“He's an enigma, I must admit.”</p>
<p>“You're lucky to have him. I pity the man for the loss of his family
and I admire his dedication to duty.”</p>
<p>Lord Scaplin asked, “Do you know why he insists on taking such lowly
jobs?”</p>
<p>“No, but it’s clearly related to the loss of his family. I did ask
him once, but he simply said, ‘A man needs to eat.’ I didn't believe
him, but I didn't want to press the point, either.”</p>
<p>“Can you at least tell me why he left your service?”</p>
<p>“The short version is that he did so for my safety and the safety of
everyone around him.”</p>
<p>“And the long version?”</p>
<p>She sighed, “That’s a story in and of itself...”</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4-ash-blood-pass">Chapter 4 Ash-Blood Pass</h2>
<p>Aaron stood beside the back gate on a summer afternoon, not moving,
staring straight ahead. The guard on the other side was sitting on the
ground and smoking, a habit that got him banned from working at the
front door and on probation. His shield was leaning against the
wall.</p>
<p>“Hey, statue, you want a smoke?” The slovenly guard asked.</p>
<p>Aaron didn't respond, simply continuing his vigil. After a lengthy
silence, he tossed his shield in the path of a projectile, saving his
comrade from death by crossbow!</p>
<p>Aaron dove right behind the shield, quickly scooped it up and brought
it to the proper position, the blocked bolt sticking out of it!</p>
<p>The slovenly guard screamed, the roll-up falling from his mouth. He
scrambled to pick up his shield and get his sword in hand as Aaron
blocked two more shots, both aimed at the lazy guard!</p>
<p>“Alert the others!” Aaron commanded.</p>
<p>The man was halfway to the house before he realized he was following
the order of someone he out-ranked! Still, it was the right thing to do,
both for their lady and his own safety! Another shot barely missed him
as he made his way to the house!</p>
<hr />
<p>Aaron took position at the center of the open gate.</p>
<p>He eyed the assailant, someone dressed in black perched on the
balcony of a nearby house, holding a crossbow. They were reloading to
make another shot.</p>
<p>Aaron knew the home. It belonged to a noble. The room itself belonged
to the man's young daughter. Clearly, it had been invaded to get a good
position to shoot from.</p>
<p>Two more shots in rapid succession revealed he was dealing with a
double crossbow, rather than two attackers. He easily blocked them.</p>
<p>Several guards arrived behind him, ready to back him up.</p>
<p>“Stay behind the walls!” He commanded with such absolute authority
that all the other guards, including the captain, obeyed without
thinking.</p>
<p>His timely words saved them from being hit as two more shots were
fired, missing one of them by inches! After a another pause to reload,
two more shots flew in, aimed at Aaron's feet! He leaped backward at
just the right moment!</p>
<p>He waited and stared the attacker right in the eye as they reloaded
and aimed. Aaron read their intent and blocked the next two with his
shield, both targeted at his head!</p>
<p>“You won't get me that way!” Aaron taunted, “Why don't you face me
like a man?”</p>
<p>The hollow laugh that came in response was unexpected, to say the
least. It was the laugh of a young woman.</p>
<p>“Man or woman, you won't take me down from a distance!”</p>
<p>The black-clad woman leaped down from the balcony, discarding her
crossbow in the same fluid movement, landing in the grass of the other
house’s yard as lightly as a cat.</p>
<p>Aaron barked, “Two guards, go and check on that house!”</p>
<p>One of the guards behind the wall responded to his order fairly
automatically, “Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>There was a bit of arguing and then the guard captain said, “I'll
take that under advisement, Mr. Kozinski!”</p>
<p>After some more muttering, two guards stepped past him and made their
way across the street. By this point, the assassin was into the
street.</p>
<p>Her attention was fixed on Aaron as she pulled off her mask,
revealing short, brown hair. She was attractive, but her expression was
of pure hatred, trying to burn holes through Aaron with her eyes
alone.</p>
<p>“Why are you here?” Aaron demanded.</p>
<p>“You killed my father! Until you're dead, the Ashen Blades will
target everyone around you, <em>especially</em> your employers!”</p>
<p>The woman rushed forward with a drawn sword, all caution thrown to
the wind and no attempt at defense even made. Aaron shook his head
slightly, braced himself for the attack and neatly positioned his sword
to skewer her as she approached, using her own momentum to drive the
blade through her chest. Through the bone-jarring impact, he kept his
footing. He withdrew his sword, dropping her to the ground.</p>
<p>She coughed a few times as she died, blood pouring from the wound and
her mouth. He wiped his sword clean on her clothes and sheathed it,
returning to his post.</p>
<p>The two guards returned and reported, “Everyone in the house is
dead!”</p>
<p>Aaron stared straight ahead. Two more attacks were aimed in his
direction that day, but neither was particularly effective. Each came
from a different house, each turning out to have been invaded, just to
get a good position to snipe from.</p>
<hr />
<p>The next morning Aaron showed up early, just to resign. Within the
hour, he paid the town crier to spread word he was leaving the city,
headed for Hallyson's Pass, a notoriously narrow path through the
mountains, impassible by cart or horse, but easy enough for a man on
foot.</p>
<p>He carried only a pack of provisions and camping supplies, a sword
and shield. He wore old regimental armor, a suit of plate mail.</p>
<p>After a day of indecision, Lady Bellany asked her guard captain to
organize and send a group of volunteers into the pass, to support
Aaron.</p>
<hr />
<p>The six volunteers, led by Lady Bellany's captain of the guard, were
each wearing their regular work attire: chain mail, sword and shield.
The captain had the double crossbow from the recent assassination
attempt strapped on his back. It was an evil device, with a cocking
mechanism that dramatically increased the strength that could be
applied, allowing even a small person to penetrate heavy armor.</p>
<p>The hike into the mountains took the better part of three days. Most
of Hallyson's Pass was little more than a deep, narrow canyon that wound
around at strange angles. However, there were wider areas, big enough to
use for camp sites. Every once in a while a small side canyon branched
off the main path, but most ended in a dead end. They got lost a few
times, having to backtrack to the main path.</p>
<p>The walls looked almost like someone painted them with a variety of
natural pigments, making horizontal lines at various heights, but that
was just layers of natural stone. Most of the canyon was a mixture of
reds and browns, with a nearly black line every so often. The lightest
colors were almost like cream. As the wind swept through, it brought the
smell of water, dirt and sand.</p>
<p>There was a little trickle of water flowing along the path; the
canyon had been carved by that stream, which turned into a deadly
torrent during storms.</p>
<p>On the third day, they began hearing sounds of fighting, echoing
through the canyon. It was impossible to tell how far away it was, but
almost as one man, the guards quickened their pace!</p>
<p>By mid-morning, they found the small stream tinged with blood,
becoming darker the farther they went.</p>
<p>Throughout the day they heard fighting, off and on. Each time, they
increased their pace, hoping to find Aaron around the next corner.</p>
<p>When noon came, they ate on the run, not wanting to stop for
lunch.</p>
<p>As they were eating and turning a corner, they came across a man
dressed in black, lying dead next to the stream at a natural pinch-point
in the canyon. While the dead man was contributing to the blood in the
stream, he was clearly not the only source, as the water was already red
by the time it reached him.</p>
<p>Within ten minutes they found another body, similarly dressed, with a
small section of the canyon wall collapsed on him. The area had clearly
been fairly narrow until the collapse.</p>
<p>The next group of bodies was three men, crammed into another choke
point, as though they'd died attempting to cross it. These had to be
removed before the guards could continue.</p>
<p>This pattern persisted. With each defensible location was a small
pile of bodies. They stopped counting after about twenty corpses, but
there were dozens more.</p>
<p>By late afternoon, they heard fighting again, so they sped onward,
running as fast as safety allowed in the narrow canyon! This time, the
fighting sounded much closer!</p>
<p>As the first of them turned a corner, there was a group of six
black-clad men, attempting to get into a side canyon! At their feet were
several more, dead. Aaron was just beyond the entrance, forcing them to
come at him one at a time.</p>
<p>Aaron's sword thrust through the gut of his current opponent,
protruding out the left side of the man's torso! With a swift kick, he
dislodged his blade just in time to be ready for his next opponent!</p>
<p>The captain readied his crossbow, took aim and launched a bolt into
one of Aaron's tormentors, going through his bicep and between his ribs,
puncturing a lung! He quickly aimed at another and fired, putting the
bolt in the man's temple, killing him nearly instantly!</p>
<p>As he dropped the bow and drew his sword, he called to his men,
“Attack!”</p>
<p>The ensuing battle was short and bloody, but the guards came out on
top. Aaron finished two of them himself, while the remaining two gave
the guards some serious trouble. The assassins were each skilled
fighters, but were soon outflanked and fighting back to back,
overwhelmed. With three opponents each, skill just wasn't enough to save
them!</p>
<p>Each of the guards was wounded, but when the captain surveyed his
men, he was happy to see none of the wounds were serious.</p>
<p>Limping a bit from a bad bruise to his leg, the captain made his way
toward Aaron and was quite surprised to find himself hastily parrying an
expertly-aimed attack, going straight for his jugular!</p>
<p>As he stumbled over a corpse, tripping and falling back, he saw the
look in Aaron's eyes. He was long past exhaustion and likely didn't even
know what was going on, running on pure combat instinct and
adrenaline!</p>
<p>As Aaron aimed a deadly strike his way, his mind worked like
lightning!</p>
<p>He raised his shield and shouted, “Kozinski! Present arms!”</p>
<p>The blade stopped just half an inch from the captain's eye!</p>
<p>Despite how exhausted he was, Aaron responded to the voice of proper
authority. He clearly obeyed without thought, presenting his weapons as
though on parade and his posture became perfectly straight. Even now,
his form was picture-perfect. The scene was rather spoiled by the fact
that the man, his armor and his weapons were all covered in blood, dirt
and sand, the reek of death and sweat wafting from him.</p>
<p>One of the men behind the captain commented, “He is human?”</p>
<p>The source of this comment was quickly shushed and smacked.</p>
<p>The captain stood, brushed himself off and ordered, “Stand at ease,
Mr. Kozinski!”</p>
<p>Aaron finally snapped out of it, looking around himself as though
he'd lost track of where he was and what was going on. He lost his
balance and started to fall to one side.</p>
<p>The captain rushed forward, catching him, “I've got you. You're
safe.”</p>
<p>Aaron was already unconscious.</p>
<hr />
<p>Aaron woke to the magnificent sound and smell of sizzling bacon. His
stomach rumbled, the most emotional response any of the guards had ever
seen from the man.</p>
<p>The sun was directly over the canyon, noon being the only time of day
that allowed direct light. They were in the small side canyon in which
Aaron had made his stand, but the guards had moved the bodies downwind,
to improve the smell of the area.</p>
<p>Without a word, he was quickly fed strip after strip of bacon, then
some cheese and finally about half a loaf of bread. This was
interspersed with several long pulls from a water skin.</p>
<p>With his hunger satisfied, he asked, “How long was I out?”</p>
<p>“Eighteen hours.” The captain said with some concern, “How long were
you fighting before we showed up?”</p>
<p>“They came at me in the dark, hit and run. I fought them at choke
points. When I got here, I knew I could hold the line. They kept at it
for at least six hours after that, rotating so each could rest. Thanks
for the help. Any of them left?”</p>
<p>“Not that we can tell. We've been vigilant.”</p>
<p>Aaron looked himself over. His armor had been removed and cleaned. He
was bandaged in a few places where the joints of the armor allowed
weapons to graze him, but on the whole, he was in better shape than the
guards, one of which was dealing with a nasty stab wound in his leg.</p>
<p>Aaron stood, walked over to the man with the stab wound and took a
good look. He wouldn't be walking any time soon, but he knew a few
things that would prevent the inevitable infection. He soon found his
pack and pulled out some first-aid supplies and a small bottle of
brandy.</p>
<p>Thinking it was for him to drink, the guard held out a hand for the
bottle.</p>
<p>First cleaning a needle and thread with the alcohol, Aaron said,
“This is going to hurt.”</p>
<p>He poured some of it into the wound. The guard cried out in pain as
Aaron worked to sew the wound shut. When he was done, he applied a fresh
bandage.</p>
<p>He handed the bottle to the man and advised, “Clean it with this,
daily. It’s not for drinking.”</p>
<p>The captain wondered aloud, “Where did you learn to do that?”</p>
<p>As Aaron sat down to rest for a bit more, he replied, “Had a really
good sawbones in my regiment, once. Said the best way to save a wounded
limb was to keep things clean. Said brandy was about the best thing for
cleaning a wound with. After I saw him save a few good men from losing a
limb, I had him train all my men.”</p>
<p>“What regiment?”</p>
<p>Aaron shook his head, “Just look at my armor.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The captain examined the armor closely and recognized the marks of a
royal guardsman. He felt extremely foolish for not having realized it
sooner, but the last time he'd paid attention to the armor, it had been
soaked in blood.</p>
<p>Turning back to Aaron, he demanded, “Why in the world were you
serving as a gate guard?”</p>
<p>Aaron sighed, “Man's gotta eat.”</p>
<p>“True, but why aren't you doing something more important?”</p>
<p>Aaron redirected, “Why aren't you? You're good at your job and you
care for your men. You could be in my old regiment if you wanted.”</p>
<p>“I didn't think the king would hire a commoner for his personal
regiment.”</p>
<p>Aaron nodded, “Used to be the case, yes, but not in recent years.
When we get back, I'll write you a letter. You can take it to the king's
steward.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The captain was so dumbfounded, he’d forgot his question, just as
Aaron intended.</p>
<p>After another day of rest, the group headed back the way they'd come,
with Aaron in the lead. Vultures were all over the canyon as they
walked, working overtime to clean up the mess.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lady Bellany finished, “After that, the Ashen Blades were no more and
Hallyson's Pass was renamed Ash-Blood Pass. Personally, I consider the
new name to be remarkably poor taste, but it was quite some time before
the bones washed out completely.</p>
<p>“It wasn't long before my guard captain was invited to join the
king's regiment. Seems Aaron took a liking to the man and recommended
him to the king. I wholeheartedly agreed with that assessment, but was
sad to lose such a capable captain.”</p>
<p>Lord Scaplin sighed, “The more questions I ask about Aaron Kozinski,
the more I learn of his impeccable character, but no one seems to know
what motivates him.”</p>
<p>“Why does it matter to you so much? Isn't it enough to know you can
trust him?”</p>
<p>“How can I trust a man that refuses to tell me why he works for
peanuts at the lowliest job he can find? I need to know!”</p>
<p>The Lady smiled and chuckled a little, “Don't let it bother you. The
king himself vouched for his character, as you well know. Just be
grateful you've got him.”</p>
<p>He sighed again, “You're right, of course. You're absolutely
right.”</p>
<h2 id="chapter-5-noble-demand">Chapter 5 Noble Demand</h2>
<p>The meeting came to a close and he headed home, resolving to take her
advice. As his coach passed through the front gate, with Aaron at his
post in his usual motionless pose, the puzzle began to nag him again. He
couldn't just let it lie.</p>
<p>Once the coach was parked, he stepped out and headed straight to the
gate.</p>
<p>Aaron saluted.</p>
<p>Lord Scaplin demanded, quite flustered, “Why? Why are you content to
work as a gate guard?”</p>
<p>Aaron gave his usual response, “It feeds me and pays my rent,
sir.”</p>
<p>“I don't believe you! You could be doing something important! Why
this, in particular?”</p>
<p>Aaron shrugged, “Why not?”</p>
<p>Lord Scaplin stared hard at the man for close to two minutes and a
new approach occurred to him, “I order you to tell me the truth about
why you're working as a gate guard!”</p>
<p>Aaron's normally expressionless face twisted into a wince, as if he’d
been slapped. He didn't respond for a long moment.</p>
<p>Lord Scaplin demanded, “Well? What have you to say for yourself?”</p>
<p>Aaron's face returned to normal, “I refuse to answer. Sir, I'm afraid
that I must inform you of my intention to resign.”</p>
<p>More quietly and calmly, Lord Scaplin asked, “On what grounds?”</p>
<p>“Invasion of my privacy, sir.”</p>
<p>Lord Scaplin's jaw dropped, but he soon closed it, “I apologize and I
understand.”</p>
<p>With a final salute, Aaron left his post and heading for the guard
captain's office, to turn in his uniform and equipment.</p>
<p>Lord Scaplin felt extremely foolish for his actions, but in a strange
way, also relieved. The puzzle of Aaron Kozinski was no longer his
problem. Before Aaron left, he gave him a letter of recommendation to
add to his collection, for he truly had great respect for the man. No
previous guard had behaved so well during long hours at their post.</p>
<h1 id="tale-3-collision">Tale 3 Collision</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-1-gainful-employment">Chapter 1 Gainful Employment</h2>
<p>As Aaron walked home that day, he was approached by a small man
dressed in fine clothes. He had naturally curled brown hair.</p>
<p>“Good afternoon!” The young man called to him.</p>
<p>Aaron nodded.</p>
<p>“Since you're walking the street instead of guarding Lord Scaplin's
front gate, would I be right in guessing you've quit left his
employ?”</p>
<p>Aaron nodded, “Yes.”</p>
<p>“Are you looking for a new gate to guard?”</p>
<p>“I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Why don't you guard my front door? I've heard nothing but good
things about you! I've been green with envy that Lord Scaplin managed to
hire you!”</p>
<p>“I'll consider it. Your name, please?”</p>
<p>The man bowed, “Marcus Rawlings. I run a very <em>exclusive</em>
gentleman's club and could use a good man for the door.”</p>
<p>Aaron talked it over with him, listening for any downside. The pay
was good, he'd be doing some reasonably important work, protecting the
club's clients, mostly nobles, and most important of all, his
responsibility was simply to guard the door.</p>
<p>“I’ll take the job.” Aaron informed his new employer, who eagerly led
him away, to see the door he would be guarding.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-the-would-be-kidnapper">Chapter 2 The Would-Be
Kidnapper</h2>
<p>The priestess leaned over a man lying on his belly, as she changed a
bandage on a his back. The wound was from a particularly nasty scythe
accident and had left him unable to work, due to both the injury and the
resulting fever. The infection was gone and the wound was finally
healing nicely. She was grateful she wouldn't have to call on the doctor
again. There would still be some pretty bad scarring, but he was out of
the woods, after months of care.</p>
<p>She stood, straightened her spine and declared, “I'm done for today.
You're healing well, I'm glad to say. Get some more rest.”</p>
<p>He thanked her.</p>
<p>She stepped out of the sick room where she cared for those with no
one else to care for them. The main hall of the modest temple was small,
with just a few pews for services.</p>
<p>She reflected on the king's change of heart so many years before,
when she'd chastised him for his greed. Within a few years he actually
came to her, in person, to thank her. It was incredible to see the
growth in the man as he looked to his people's needs and did his best to
care for them, in an almost fatherly fashion, treating his people as
though they were the child he’d lost.</p>
<p>Eventually, the king offered to fund the construction of a grand
temple. The priestess thanked him, asked for just enough to build a
small temple and insisted he use the rest of the money to serve the
poor.</p>
<p>It was a happy day for the kingdom when he remarried. The priestess
had officiated, in the very temple she was stood in.</p>
<p>She rubbed her aching back. Stooping so long to take care of that man
on a daily basis was beginning to give her trouble with her own body.
Still, she didn't want to complain; others had it worse.</p>
<p>She crossed the hall and entered her private quarters. There was a
full-size standing mirror there, a gift from the king. She glanced at
her reflection briefly. She was getting older, her blonde hair beginning
to lose all color. She still wore it short, though. Long hair was a
bother when she was working, so she'd always kept it short.</p>
<p>Her plain, white robe was one of the simple, practical ones she
always wore while working. It was both something to wear and a source of
emergency bandages. She wore an extra-long one just for that reason. She
had better robes, but they were for ceremonial occasions and she didn't
like wearing them, anyway.</p>
<p>She mused to herself that she needed an apprentice, to take her place
when she died, but she figured there was plenty of time for that to be
arranged.</p>
<p>Just as she was about to sit down and read a book on medicinal herbs,
the outer doors of the temple opened.</p>
<p>Someone cried out, “Sister! We need you!”</p>
<p>She could hear the fear pouring out of the young woman's voice.</p>
<p>“What is it?” The priestess shouted as she quickly made her way back
into the hall!</p>
<p>“Strangers in the village, stealing children!”</p>
<p>The priestess ran down the hall and accelerated past the upset young
woman! The two of them raced to the village as fast as possible!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the priestess had to stop for a breather, halfway
there. In retrospect, she wished she'd accepted the king's offer of a
horse and stable for the temple. At the time, she'd been a bit younger
and with no aches in her back. Now, it seemed a reasonable
suggestion.</p>
<p>When they arrived, she found a group of masked men beating one of the
village men! Behind them was a cart full of children from the
village!</p>
<p>She rushed forward, diving in the path of a kick, aiming to take the
blow in the crotch! The attacker fell back, clutching his family jewels
in pain!</p>
<p>The priestess grimaced, but got to her feet, standing between the man
and his attackers.</p>
<p>One of them swung a mace at her and she put her face in its path. The
mace-wielder fell back with a badly-bleeding shattered nose!</p>
<p>Next was a short sword, jabbed in her direction! She blocked with her
bare hand, leaving the man bleeding from his sword hand!</p>
<p>She stood her ground and shrugged off the momentary pain of their
wounds. Having seen three men attack her, only to injure themselves, the
others gave her a wide berth.</p>
<p>“Just what in the world is going on here?” She demanded.</p>
<p>One of the men at the back of the cart, not having seen the
commotion, raised a crossbow and fired. The priestess was hit in the
gut, but the bolt simply bounced off. The crossbow wielder dropped his
weapon and screamed in pain!</p>
<p>She dropped to her knees, having failed to notice the man fire. When
she recovered, she got back on her feet and slapped her way through the
crowd of kidnappers toward the cart! As each of them attacked, they fell
back, suffering the wounds they would have inflicted on her! She barely
twitched with the pain of each strike.</p>
<p>She pushed several of the masked men aside and shouted to the
children, “Get back to your parents! I'll keep them busy!”</p>
<p>The children leaped from the cart and bolted in all directions as
soon as they were safely away! The priestess smiled in grim
satisfaction.</p>
<p>She ran into the group of kidnappers, wildly kicking, punching and
screaming defiance! The masked men were soon a mass of confusion and
chaos! They tried to stop her, but to no avail!</p>
<p>The distraction was complete. Armed villagers began showing up on the
edges of the scene, carrying scythes, sickles, pitchforks and other
tools that could easily be used as weapons.</p>
<p>When she finally stopped fighting and stepped out of the melee, they
were surrounded by angry villagers!</p>
<p>“Thank you, sister.” The mayor said as she stepped beside him.</p>
<p>The kidnappers were soon rounded up and their wounds tended. They
were herded, at the point of farm implements, to a barn that would serve
as a make-shift prison for the day or two it would take to get some
law-men to take them away. The mask was pulled from each as their hands
were bound.</p>
<p>However, just before he was disarmed and unmasked, one of the men
managed to slip away, running much faster than anyone could follow! As
the men of the village tried to tackle him, he stabbed two of them with
the pair of matched daggers he wielded!</p>
<p>The priestess watched as he crested a small hill and looked back,
straight at her. He removed his mask, giving everyone a good look at his
features. He was young, with naturally curly brown hair.</p>
<p>Without taking his eyes off her, he bowed as a taunt and then ran.
When the men following him reached the top of the hill, he was long
gone. Beyond the hill was a thick forest, where it would be easy to
escape. The men searched until late evening, but to no avail.</p>
<p>After everything was over, the priestess held a meeting, where
everyone shared what they could remember of what the man looked like. By
the end of the day, she had two copies of a good drawing of the man.</p>
<p>Questioning revealed the men were mercenaries and the man that
escaped was their employer. None knew why the man wanted a wagon full of
children.</p>
<p>When the law men came, one copy of the drawing was given to them, but
the priestess knew that would do no good. It was rare for such an
incident to result in an arrest, unless they were caught red-handed.
There just weren't enough law men to go around.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3-bar-breaker">Chapter 3 Bar Breaker</h2>
<p>It had been years since the priestess entered the royal city. The
last visit had been to meet and bless the royal couple's first-born.</p>
<p>She didn't like the city. It was too big, but these days there were
other priests of her religion to look after the larger flock. She
preferred her small, rural flock, where it was still possible to learn
and remember everyone's name.</p>
<p>She knew she'd likely be gone for quite some time, so she left her
patient in the hands of the women of the village. With any luck, that
would lead to the poor man finding a wife.</p>
<p>She started her investigation by visiting a local law man, one of
those that came to the village for the mercenaries, gaining a promise to
hold the suspect for an inquiry if she brought him in and an apology
that he couldn't do more. After a long discussion of where to begin her
search for the ring-leader, she made her way to the seedier section of
the city. She showed the drawing to the ruffians on the street, with
little success.</p>
<p>Around mid-afternoon on the third day, a huge man, just shy of seven
feet tall, carrying a rather large club, approached her and declared,
loudly, “You the lady been askin' 'bout the boss? He be angry you
askin'!”</p>
<p>She grinned, “Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.” She held up the drawing and
asked, “Is this the boss?”</p>
<p>The brute squinted at the drawing and stupidly smiled, “Yeah, dat's
him!”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” She laughed in his face, “Where can I find him?”</p>
<p>The brute looked confused for a moment as he took the time to
perform, what was for him, the very difficult task of thinking.</p>
<p>He arrived at a shaky conclusion, “Hey! You trick me!”</p>
<p>The brute's club was swung overhead, in both hands! She calmly
reached up and blocked the incredible blow with her right forearm. She
felt the pain of the break as she heard the brute's bones crack!</p>
<p>He roared in pain, his badly-damaged arm dropping to his side, parts
of it moving at unnatural angles. He still held the club in the other
hand and raised it for another strike!</p>
<p>Not wishing to see the man lose the use of his other arm, she dodged
and shouted, “Do you want another broken arm?”</p>
<p>It did no good as the man screamed in blind rage and attacked again.
She blocked with the other arm, wincing from the pain as she saw the
man's arm collapse! The club tumbled away, rolling into the gutter.</p>
<p>There were a number of people on the street that took notice of the
biggest bully around, seemingly beaten by a small woman. Two dirty
street children, a boy and a girl, picked up the club and ran away down
an alley. She wasn't sure of the significance of this, but her attention
was focused on the man before her, who wouldn't even be able to feed
himself.</p>
<p>He dropped to the pavement, wailing like an extremely large, injured
toddler!</p>
<p>She knelt beside him and put a hand on his shoulder. She willed most
of the pain into herself, leaving just enough that the foolish man
wouldn't hurt himself further.</p>
<p>She spoke soothing words and helped him to stand, keeping a hand on
him at all times, to take the pain.</p>
<p>From one of the astonished on-lookers, she demanded, “Where's the
nearest doctor?”</p>
<p>At this point, she realized everyone on the street was staring.
Several of them pointed just down the street, where there was actually a
small, wooden sign of a saw crossed over a bone. She'd never actually
seen a doctor advertise themselves as a sawbones. That was usually an
insult laid on them by others.</p>
<p>She walked the blubbering man into the clinic.</p>
<p>Someone male screamed, “Bar Breaker, you know you're not welcome
here!”</p>
<p>The priestess moved around to the front of the large man and
explained as she maneuvered him to an open bed, “I'm sorry. You just
happened to be the nearest doctor and this foolish man just broke both
his arms attacking me.”</p>
<p>She finally got a good look at the doctor and the room.</p>
<p>He was middle-aged, his hair starting to gray and wearing a
short-sleeved white shirt, a black tie and a black apron. He looked more
like a mortician than a doctor.</p>
<p>The room had four sick beds and a small desk at the back. Behind the
desk was a small surgical room beyond an archway and a set of stairs
that probably led to the doctor's bedroom. There was a very chemical
smell in the room.</p>
<p>He sighed, “Very well. Will someone be paying for his treatment or is
this supposed to be free?”</p>
<p>With her other hand, the priestess removed a few gold from her
coin-purse and tossed them to the man, “Will that do for a start?”</p>
<p>He grumbled a bit, but got to work, setting and splinting the huge
man's broken forearms; one gold would have been far more than required,
but she’d been impatient and wanted the doctor to stop complaining.</p>
<p>As he worked, the doctor volunteered, “Everyone around here calls me
Doc, but I'd prefer to be called Dr. Petrov.”</p>
<p>She shrugged, “I'm afraid I gave up my name in the service of my god,
long ago. You can call me 'sister', but it’s more an honorific than a
name.”</p>
<p>With a hint of recognition in his eyes and a glance at the way she
was keeping a hand on Bar Breaker, he commented, “You're one of those
empathy priests, aren't you?”</p>
<p>She nodded, “The fool hit me with a club, twice. That wasn't a wise
thing to do. Could have been worse, though. Someone tried to cut my head
off, once.”</p>
<p>The doctor blanched, “Those who don't learn from their mistakes
sometimes don't get the chance to repeat them.”</p>
<p>As Dr. Petrov completed his work, he injected the large man and then
said, “You can let go in a moment. He'll be out for hours. When he comes
to, I'll give him something for the pain.”</p>
<p>Within a minute, the huge man was snoring quite loudly, sounding
something like an industrial accident in progress. The doctor lifted his
patient's head, turned it to one side and tucked a pillow under it,
somewhat reducing the volume of the snore.</p>
<p>He headed toward his desk, gestured for her to sit in one of the
chairs in front of it and sat down behind it. As she tried to get
comfortable on the worn-out seat, he handed back the coins she'd given
him.</p>
<p>He answered her quizzical expression by explaining, “I've thought it
over. Keep your money. It’s more than worth it to see Bar Breaker off
the street for a while, since he causes so many injuries.”</p>
<p>She nodded, “Hopefully, he'll learn something from this.”</p>
<p>“Probably not,” he chuckled, “but at least he won't be hurting anyone
for a few months. So, what brings you to our little slice of
heaven?”</p>
<p>She produced the now-battered drawing of the man she was searching
for from a pocket and smoothed it out on the desk, “I'm looking for this
man. Bar Breaker called him 'the boss.' He hired mercenaries to kidnap
children from my village.”</p>
<p>The doctor looked the picture over and scratched his stubbly chin, “I
know I've seen him around, but I can't quite place where.”</p>
<p>She sighed, “I was hoping to question our large friend, but I'm not
sure he would be willing to help. He attacked when I asked where I could
find the man.”</p>
<p>The doctor smiled, “People around here aren't usually helpful to
outsiders, even if they could be, but I think everyone on the street
knows you just took down Bar Breaker. He's feared on the streets as a
malicious thug for hire. There should be more than enough good-will for
you out there. Try asking again.”</p>
<p>She nodded as she rose and shook his hand, “Thank you.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she had no luck the rest of that day, but she did
notice that most of the people she met smiled at her and now greeted her
warmly, while the ruffians on the street shied away, fearfully.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4-a-lovely-meeting">Chapter 4 A Lovely Meeting</h2>
<p>As the priestess walked the streets the next day, she saw a pair of
dirty children, a boy and a girl. She recognized them as the pair that
ran off with Bar Breaker's club. They were lurking at the edge of an
alley.</p>
<p>“Hey! Lady!” The girl called out, smiling.</p>
<p>She made her way over and asked, “Yes?”</p>
<p>The pair were not more than twelve years old and looked about the
same age. They shared the same shade of black hair and had more than a
passing resemblance, causing her to guess they were twins. They wore
rags that barely qualified as clothes.</p>
<p>“You're looking for somebody, right?” The girl asked.</p>
<p>She nodded, “Yes, I am.”</p>
<p>She showed them the drawing and the girl shrugged, “I don't know him,
but I know someone that should.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>The boy sighed, “Follow me. Our boss seemed pretty happy about what
you did to Bar Breaker, so I think he'll help you find that guy.”</p>
<p>The pair led her down a fairly direct route that passed through
various streets, alleys and briefly, the back of a blacksmith's shop,
eventually arriving at a decrepit warehouse that seemed to be a
squatter's camp.</p>
<p>There was a man there, sitting on a wooden crate. His head was shaved
and he bore a tattoo of an eagle on his scalp, with the wings coming
down the sides of his head, just like sideburns, with the beak coming to
a point on his forehead. The eagle's eyes seemed to meet a person's
gaze, regardless of the angle. If the man grew his hair out, it looked
like the whole thing would vanish into it.</p>
<p>As he looked up, he asked, “Would you be the woman that took down Bar
Breaker?”</p>
<p>She shrugged, “I suppose I am.”</p>
<p>He grinned wide, revealing a number of gold teeth, “You have my
thanks. You still looking for his boss?”</p>
<p>“He tried to kidnap some children from my village. I plan to bring
him to justice.” She explained.</p>
<p>He grinned evilly, “Then that makes us friends!”</p>
<p>“How do you figure?”</p>
<p>“The enemy of my enemy is my friend!” He laughed, “He's been a thorn
in my side for the past ten years. I'd love to see him at the
gallows!”</p>
<p>“Where can I find him?”</p>
<p>He pulled a small scrap of grubby paper from a pocket, tore off an
unused section wrote on it with a piece of charcoal and handed it over,
“He frequents a gentleman's club at that address. Good hunting!”</p>
<p>She bowed, thanked him and headed back to the inn she was staying in,
where she had a map of the city, since she didn't recognize the name of
the street.</p>
<hr />
<p>When the priestess was long gone, the man stopped grinning and said
to the children, “Why do you think Marcus wanted us to send her straight
to him? We could have sent her somewhere dangerous.”</p>
<p>The boy sighed, “Marcus has a mind like a bag full of angry
cats.”</p>
<p>“It’s probably a trap.” The girl sported a wicked-looking grin of
mischief.</p>
<p>“He hired Bar Breaker to warn her off,” the man shrugged, “but also
hired us to send her straight there. Makes no sense.”</p>
<p>“Is it any of our business?” The boy sighed again, “He paid us to do
a job and we've done it. Can we get out of these awful clothes, now?
They itch.”</p>
<p>“You're right, of course. Let's head home. I’ll have the servants
draw you a nice, hot bath.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The priestess approached the club, named Rawlings', after its owner.
It was in one of the better neighborhoods, where all the houses had
guards. The building was red brick, with only very small windows on the
ground floor, about the same size as arrow slits on a castle. There was
a pair of double doors at the front, with a single guard on duty,
standing perfectly still, staring into space.</p>
<p>After half an hour of surreptitiously skulking around the building,
she discovered it once had a back entrance, but that was now blocked
with new bricks.</p>
<p>She watched the entrance for some time. Male nobles entered and
exited, as well as some servants, both male and female. It looked like
the only way a woman was allowed in was as a servant.</p>
<p>She decided to try the direct approach. She walked straight up to the
door, using the confidence that comes of being practically
untouchable.</p>
<p>As she came near the door, the guard, Aaron Kozinski, stepped neatly
in her path, blocking the way.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, young man, but I need to go in there.” She spoke
boldly.</p>
<p>Aaron finally looked her in the eye, “You don't work here and you're
not a gentleman, so you're definitely not a member.”</p>
<p>She backed away, out of his personal space, and pulled out the
drawing of the man she was looking for, “I need to find this man. I'm
told he frequents this club. Is he inside?”</p>
<p>Without even looking at the drawing, Aaron shrugged, “Couldn't tell
you.”</p>
<p>“Can't or won't?” She demanded.</p>
<p>“Both.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“I protect the club's clients. That includes their privacy.”</p>
<p>The priestess took a better look at the man. He was wearing chain
mail and a black and white striped tabard with the club's symbol on it,
a pair of crossed, black daggers. He also wore plate gauntlets and a
pair of heavy, plate boots. His helmet covered the top of his head and
had a nose guard, but left most of his face and neck exposed. He held a
round shield with the club's symbol and wore a sheathed sword on his
belt.</p>
<hr />
<p>With a brief flick of his eyes, Aaron assessed the threat the
priestess posed. She carried no weapons, but he recognized her robes.
She was an empath-priest. That would make it tricky to stop her, but not
impossible.</p>
<hr />
<p>She tried a new approach, not wanting to fight, “The man I'm looking
for tried to kidnap children from my village. I want to bring him to
justice.”</p>
<p>“Have you any proof?”</p>
<p>“My own word and the word of many of my village, as
eye-witnesses.”</p>
<p>“I'm just supposed to take your word for it?” The guard spoke without
a hint of emotion.</p>
<p>She tried several more arguments, but each was defeated by Aaron, who
was using impeccable, cold logic. She argued more heatedly. It was then
that a window on an upper floor was opened, making a loud squeak as the
old hinge was forced to work for the first time in years.</p>
<p>She looked up as a head poked out the window to look down at the both
of them. It was the man she was looking for! He even winked at her! She
was so shocked that she didn't say or do anything.</p>
<p>With a smug grin on his face, he called out, “Aaron, you having
trouble with her? Do you need some backup?”</p>
<p>Aaron called back, “No trouble, sir.”</p>
<p>“Carry on, then!”</p>
<p>The man disappeared back inside, accompanied by distant laughter, and
the squeaky hinge was forced to work in reverse.</p>
<p>The priestess finally recovered from the shock of seeing the man,
pointed at the window and shouted, “That was him!”</p>
<hr />
<p>Aaron remained silent. She still hadn't given him any proof.</p>
<p>She backed away, getting ready to charge. Seeing this, he drew his
sword. He didn't want to hurt her, but it was better to be ready for
anything.</p>
<p>She ran straight at him! Aaron braced for the impact and made no
hostile move. He brought his shield up at the last moment, putting it
right in the path of her face! He angled his sword in the same instant
to cut into her leg, careful to be certain the force of her impact was
what damaged her. If she was going to attack, then he was going to make
it hurt. The crunch of her nose breaking and the clang of her skull on
his shield echoed around the street! Blood poured from her leg around a
fresh hole in her robe, staining it!</p>
<p>Her momentum pushed her upward, over the shield, as her feet came off
the pavement! Aaron shoved her away, leaving her sprawled on the ground.
With his back already against the doors, the reverse force wasn't enough
to knock him down.</p>
<p>She groaned for a moment and slowly got into a sitting position. She
looked confused and probably had a concussion. She tore a bit of cloth
from the hem of her robe and bandaged her leg. She tore another strip
free to press to her nose.</p>
<p>Aaron assumed his usual stance, staring straight ahead. He didn't
move to his usual position at the side of the door, though. He cleaned
his sword with a cloth from his pocket and then sheathed it. He also
wiped the blood off his shield.</p>
<hr />
<p>After half an hour, the bleeding from the priestess’ nose finally
stopped and she got to her feet. She eyed her opponent. He was a smart
one and if she was to get past him, she needed to learn more about
him.</p>
<p>She limped forward, got right in his face and demanded, “Why are you
protecting him?”</p>
<p>“Why not? I've no proof he did anything.”</p>
<p>She flailed at the man with no force, simply trying to make
skin-to-skin contact. It wasn't an easy thing to do, since only his face
and neck were available. He blocked most of her strikes, but she managed
to touch his cheek with a single finger!</p>
<h2 id="chapter-5-the-price-of-empathy">Chapter 5 The Price of
Empathy</h2>
<p>Aaron held his dead wife. Hours passed and it was well into the
night. The last vestiges of the fire were out.</p>
<p>The peasants tried to get him to let her go several times, but he
snarled at them like an animal! Eventually, one of his lieutenants came
to see him, but had no success in reaching him. Finally, at nearly dawn,
the king arrived.</p>
<p>The king spoke firmly, as though giving a command, “Aaron, put her
down!” More calmly, he continued, “Let her go. She's already gone.”</p>
<p>Aaron trembled, clearly in conflict. He stopped trembling and put
down his wife. He looked at the king, a mixture of impotent rage and
duty on his face.</p>
<p>The king, quite unexpected, moved to the man and embraced him, “I'm
sorry. You should have been here. You should have been home.”</p>
<p>Aaron went limp in his king's arms, sobbing like a child.</p>
<hr />
<p>The mixture of conflicted grief, anger and duty hit the priestess
like an exploding mountain! The force of it was the single worst thing
she'd experienced in all her years as a priestess. The power of it
knocked her flat on her back!</p>
<p>Riding on the tail of it was a powerful wave of mind-numbing
apathy.</p>
<p>Beyond that was duty, filling the man's mind from one mental horizon
to the other. As the duty filled every nook and cranny, a fresh wave of
apathy washed over it and the two layered together, almost as one,
single emotion. His duty was, miraculously, being fed by his apathy. His
apathy was, in turn, feeding on his duty.</p>
<p>There were no vulnerabilities in that armor, no chinks. The man would
never budge, would never falter, would never give up. Never again would
he love. Neither would he hate. All he cared for was duty. All he lived
for was duty. He would die before he surrendered, but he would
<em>never</em> break.</p>
<p>The priestess was paralyzed by the emotions rushing through her mind!
Never before had she touched such feelings. It was a long moment before
she realized the man's feelings were so powerful, she'd lost herself in
them!</p>
<p>As she applied her training and focused her mind, the intensity of
the experience reduced, slowly. She got to her feet, very unsteadily.
She eyed the man in fear; she'd rather feel the pain of another severed
head, than ever touch the man again! He was living in what others would
consider the worst kind of torture, a personal, living hell, and he
<em>preferred</em> it that way!</p>
<p>Aaron looked down at the stricken woman and said, “Ma'am, please
don't touch me.”</p>
<p>Trembling with shock, she limped away, having decided to cut her
losses, for the time being. She needed medical attention, time to
consider and a much better plan of attack.</p>
<p>Aaron returned to his post.</p>
<hr />
<p>Mr. Orlov, more commonly known as Eagle, the man with the tattooed
scalp, watched the scene with interest. He also eyed Marcus the same
way. The other members of the club, all gathered around the windows,
simply thought the spectacle a sort of rare entertainment.</p>
<p>When the woman was gone, he asked, “Why bring her here?”</p>
<p>Marcus grinned, “I owe a debt to someone.”</p>
<p>“Who?” Eagle asked.</p>
<p>“My guard, down there.”</p>
<p>Eagle's only response was a quizzical expression.</p>
<p>Marcus elaborated, “Ever hear of the Ashen Blades?”</p>
<p>“Assassin clan that got wiped out by some gate guard, right?” Eagle
nodded.</p>
<p>“He's the guard.”</p>
<p>“And your stake in this?”</p>
<p>“I'm the last of the Ashen Blades.” Marcus whispered, all mirth gone
from his face, “I want him to suffer.”</p>
<p>“You think that priestess can manage that?”</p>
<p>Marcus grinned evilly, “I'm counting on it.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The priestess limped into the clinic a few hours later. Bar Breaker
was sitting on his sick bed, trying to find a way to hold a spoon
without pain, with both arms in a splint. There was a bowl of soup in
front of him on a rolling tray.</p>
<p>Dr. Petrov rushed to her side and helped her to one of the beds.</p>
<p>After examined her leg, he asked, “What happened to you? Looks like
someone stabbed you, but I can't believe that's possible.”</p>
<p>She grunted as he poured a stinging liquid on the wound that smelled
of brandy and began stitching.</p>
<p>Her voice sounded a bit odd, due to the broken nose, “Indirect force.
I charged. Blocked me. Sword, shield.”</p>
<p>“I guess that explains your nose, too. Sounds like the man knows your
limits.”</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>He finished stitching her up and then instructed, “Let me see that
nose.”</p>
<p>He spent a few minutes examining her and then brought her a cold, wet
cloth to hold to it.</p>
<p>As she sat and held the cloth to her swollen nose, he asked, “Who did
this to you?”</p>
<p>She muttered, “Guard. Rawlings'.”</p>
<p>“Ah! That's why I knew the face of the man in your picture. He's
Marcus Rawlings. He owns a gentleman's club.”</p>
<p>“Who's the guard?” She asked.</p>
<p>“Aaron Kozinski. I know him from my days in the king's regiment, as
their medic. Taught his men how to keep their limbs after serious
injuries.”</p>
<p>“More, please.” She grunted.</p>
<p>He sighed and shook his head, “Aaron's story is quite tragic. I don't
know the details, though. The king or one of his men could tell you, if
you happen to know one of them well.”</p>
<p>The priestess smiled, nodded and then let someone take care of her
for once, instead of the other way around.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-6-the-undelivered-letter">Chapter 6 The Undelivered
Letter</h2>
<p>Three days later, the priestess paid a visit to the king, who was
overjoyed to see her.</p>
<p>“Sister! It’s so good to see you!”</p>
<p>The throne room was different. There were fewer expensive decorations
about and, based on the long table, the room was now a sort of meeting
hall. There was a group of nobles working with city planners at the
table, a set of maps spread out and being argued over.</p>
<p>The king gestured her toward a side chamber and followed her in. It
was a small sitting room, for smaller meetings. The queen was already in
the room, examining some papers with an irritated expression on her
face. When she looked up and saw the priestess, she smiled broadly and
greeted her warmly.</p>
<p>Once they were all seated and pleasantries out of the way, the king
asked, “What brings you to us?”</p>
<p>She told them the complete story of how she'd met the guard now
serving the gentleman's club as a bouncer, including his name.</p>
<p>The king's face clouded with grief, “The man I failed.”</p>
<p>The queen held her husband's arm, to comfort him, as he told the
man's story from start to finish, even including some details of his
life since leaving the king's regiment.</p>
<p>When he got to the story of the man losing his family, the priestess
muttered, “That explains the grief, duty and apathy, all at once.”</p>
<p>The king expressed his own grief, “I should have left my regiment in
place. I shouldn't have sent him away from the city. It’s my fault his
family is gone!”</p>
<p>The priestess shook her head, “No, my king. It isn't. You made the
best decision you could have. The other regiments were too far away.
Yes, it cost a man his family, but you saved many more families. The
blame lies on the shoulders of the arsonist.”</p>
<p>The queen smiled and silently mouthed, “Thank you.”</p>
<p>After a long pause to digest her words, the king asked, “Would you
like royal assistance? I'd be happy to loan you a few of my best
men.”</p>
<p>She considered, “No. Our friendship is too well known and this is
likely to get messy in the end. I don't want to drag you into it.”</p>
<p>He nodded, “Very well.”</p>
<p>“Do you know the man's heart?”</p>
<p>“No.” The king's eyes became watery as he admitted, “He wouldn't
explain why he resigned. I think he felt he couldn't explain without
offending me. My guess is he blames me for the loss of his wife.”</p>
<p>She nodded, “You may be right about that. His heart was in conflict,
at the time. His grief and his duty couldn't be reconciled. Now, his
heart dwells in a place filled with a mixture of apathy and duty. To
him, they're now one and the same. He feels nothing else. I've never
touched such feelings before.” She shuddered, “I hope never to do so
again.”</p>
<p>“What can I do to help?”</p>
<p>“I need to reach him, to find or make a crack in his emotional armor.
Please, tell me about his wife and daughter.”</p>
<p>With a sniff to force back some tears, the queen spoke, “His wife's
name was Kassandra. She had a warm and gentle nature. Very loving and
devoted to her husband. It was wonderful to see the way his eyes lit up
every time he saw her. She was a good friend and I dearly miss her.”</p>
<p>The king smiled at the memory and cried at the loss, “Their
daughter's name was Sasha. She was a toddler at the time, always happy,
like I remember her mother. She loved her father and was always excited
to see him when he came home.”</p>
<p>The priestess asked, “Do you think his wife would approve of the way
he's living his life?”</p>
<p>“No.” The queen shook her head, “I know that for a fact.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>“She once gave me a letter to give to him, in the case of her death,
but I haven't seen him since. I planned to give it to him the next time
he came to the castle. At the time, I thought he was simply taking time
to grieve. It was several weeks before I asked and was told he'd
resigned. He felt so strongly about resigning that I didn't want to
cause him more pain, by reminding him of his loss. I think that was an
error in judgment, now.”</p>
<p>The priestess asked, “May I have the letter?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.” The queen nodded and excused herself, to retrieve
it.</p>
<p>The king spoke, “I just want Aaron to be happy. I think you may have
a good chance of moving him in the right direction. You're the first to
know his feelings since the loss of his wife. Please, try to help
him.</p>
<p>“I don't know if it will do you any good or not, but I'll write a
letter for you to take to Aaron, to vouch for your character.”</p>
<p>The king took a few minutes to write the letter and sealed it with
wax and his signet ring.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes, the queen was back, with the letter from
Aaron's wife.</p>
<p>The priestess thanked them and departed.</p>
<hr />
<p>After another three days to heal, she approached the club, still
limping slightly. Aaron was at his post, beside the door.</p>
<p>She stepped in front of him, “I've spoken with the king and queen
about you.”</p>
<p>She handed him the letter from the king, which he opened and read.
With that complete, he stuffed it into his tunic, under his chain mail,
showing no sign of emotion.</p>
<p>“The queen gave me a letter Kassandra wrote for you before she
died.”</p>
<p>Aaron flinched, ever so slightly, at the sound of his wife’s name.
She pulled it out.</p>
<p>“I'm going to read it to you.” She said and then began.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>To my dearest husband, Aaron,</em></p>
<p><em>If you're reading this, then I've died, probably
unexpectedly.</em></p>
<p><em>Initially, I thought the idea of this letter morbid and
disturbing, but as I've watched you go out each day, to patrol the city,
I've worried you would never return, as you often come home injured
after fighting with criminals in the street. After some time with these
thoughts, I began instead, to worry what would happen if I
died.</em></p>
<p><em>I know how much you love me and I love you for that! You care for
me so deeply, I cry happy tears, daily. I miss you each day as you
work.</em></p>
<p><em>I know you, husband. I know your heart and I know that each of us
is the foundation for the other. I worry what may become of you, in my
absence.</em></p>
<p><em>You must go on without me. I don't like to think of sharing you
in the hereafter, but I know that you'll never be happy without a woman
at your side. When you've mourned me, in your own due time, please go
out and find someone new. Find someone that makes you happy, someone
that knows your heart.</em></p>
<p><em>Know, my husband, that this will make me happy, to know that
you're being taken care of by someone that loves you.</em></p>
<p><em>Our daughter and I are nearly always together. If by some chance
we both died, I say this is even more important. You must do as I say in
this.</em></p>
<p><em>As your wife, I beg you to obey me, without question, just this
once.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Aaron was trembling. He held out his hand for the letter. He took it
and read it for himself, quietly. He examined the signature. He knew the
delicate loops on the letter 'a' and the sharp corners on the 'K'. It
was real.</p>
<p>Tears streaked down his cheeks. He slipped the letter into his tunic,
alongside the one from the king.</p>
<p>He looked the priestess in the eye, “Thank you.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Steeling herself for the worst, she took his unresisting hand in her
own. Gratitude washed through her, mixed with both fresh and old grief.
Beyond this was remorse and a great sense of lost time. The apathy was
gone, but the duty remained. He was suffering, for now, but hopeful for
the future.</p>
<p>The priestess returned his steady gaze and for the first time since
she was a child, spoke her name aloud, “My name is Alena. I know your
need and I will forsake my calling to fill it. I can't ignore your pain,
because to do so would also mean forsaking my calling.”</p>
<p>Alena felt her empathic ability leave her, knowing full well she
would never feel it again.</p>
<p>She heard the voice of her god, in her mind, for the first and last
time: <em>Congratulations on a good choice.</em> She’d always suspected
her god was female, but hadn’t known it until she heard the voice.</p>
<p>Aaron smiled, dropped his shield and hugged her, crying on her
shoulder for quite a long time, letting out every last trapped emotion,
for the first time in years.</p>
<p>When the sobbing stopped, she whispered, softly, “Aaron, what is your
duty?”</p>
<p>He straightened up and stared into space. He pulled out the letter
from the king and re-read it.</p>
<p>“The king vouches for you and says that if you're on this quest, then
it is just. There is no higher compliment in this kingdom. By the king's
word and your own, Marcus Rawlings will face justice. My duty is to see
that done.”</p>
<p>Picking up his shield, he opened the door and marched inside.</p>
<hr />
<p>Eagle watched with great amusement as the guard marched up the
stairs.</p>
<p>Marcus screamed, “What are you doing, Aaron? You should be on duty,
by the door!”</p>
<p>Aaron paused at the threshold of the room and declared, “The king has
personally vouched for the woman waiting outside. By that, alone, I am
compelled to believe her words. I'm taking you into custody, so justice
can be done.”</p>
<p>Marcus drew a pair of daggers from hidden sheaths on each arm,
cursing at Aaron.</p>
<p>The men in the club moved away from Marcus. Aaron stepped away from
the stairs and allowed them to exit, leaving only the three of them.</p>
<p>Eagle noisily bit into an apple, grinning like the cat that ate the
canary.</p>
<p>Marcus turned his head to the man and demanded, “Do something, man!
I'll pay you whatever you want!”</p>
<p>Eagle smiled, “What, and ruin the best entertainment I've had all
year?”</p>
<p>He nodded to Aaron and bit into the apple again.</p>
<p>Aaron approached Marcus, ready for anything.</p>
<p>Marcus stepped forward and thrust with both daggers at different
angles! Aaron caught the one on the left with his shield, forcing it out
too wide to do any harm, while angling his sword for a skilled parry and
attack combination that brought the edge of his sword sliding around the
dagger's guard and into Marcus' hand!</p>
<p>Marcus dropped the dagger, bleeding.</p>
<p>He tried again, aiming his remaining weapon for one of Aaron's eyes.
Aaron parried with his sword and swung his shield at high speed,
slamming it into the man's head. There was a resounding clang that
echoed through the building and the man dropped to the floor,
unconscious!</p>
<p>Aaron cleaned his sword on Marcus' clothes and sheathed it. He easily
hefted the man over one shoulder and carried him outside.</p>
<p>Alena led the way, taking them to the law man's office. When Marcus
was safely behind bars, a comparison was made to the drawing and
everyone agreed, he was the man. Alena sent for Dr. Petrov; it wouldn't
do to let the prisoner die before he could face judgment, after all.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-7-sweet-surrender">Chapter 7 Sweet Surrender</h2>
<p>The next year brought a fresh, new spring with it. Alena was wearing
a beautiful, lace-covered wedding gown, something she thought she'd
never wear. It had been lovingly sewn by the women of the village. She
was in the main hall of the temple that had once been her home. The room
was packed and overflowing; everyone wanted to be there! The queen was
seated in the front row, crying and blowing her nose, a smile on her
face.</p>
<p>The king marched down the aisle with Alena on his arm, since her own
father was long dead. It was an odd image, since the king was younger
than her.</p>
<p>Aaron was standing there, at the front, next to the new priest, a
content smile on his face. He wore his gleaming regimental armor, having
spent the last week carefully polishing each piece to a mirror-shine.
Alena was so happy he'd gotten his old job back.</p>
<p>She was also ecstatic she was getting married! Aaron was such a
loving man and they were happy together.</p>
<p>They knelt before the priest. They exchanged vows, then rings and
were pronounced husband and wife.</p>
<p>They didn't live happily ever after, but they argued less than
average and grew old together. What more could any couple ask for?</p>
