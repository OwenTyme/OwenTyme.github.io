<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="ideas">Ideas</h1>
<p>This page is a sort of catch-all bin of ideas for novels I may write
in the future.</p>
<h2 id="demon-blood">Demon Blood</h2>
<p>This would be a spin-off of <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html">Ashen
Blades</a> centered around the life of James Simmons. He’s a fairy, like
his mother, Lara, but he appears totally normal until probably the age
of fifteen or sixteen, at which point he’s badly injured and needs an
emergency transfusion.</p>
<p>The only person available at the time with a compatible blood type is
the Hunter/Artemis Watson, a half-demon. She donates her blood and the
it activates all of the young man’s dormant powers.</p>
<p>He also turns out to be rather good at demon extermination, able to
force demons to transform, with a touch. He uses this power to forcibly
turn demons into weapons, which he uses to kill others. Best of all: his
power fully drains his weapons of all magic, permanently killing
them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he becomes a half-demon, and the demons now seek to
use him in their plots to conquer the world, very similar to
Artemis.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-left-to-chance">Nothing Left to Chance</h2>
<p>Death is a job passed from one mortal to another over the centuries,
a job with a great many perks, including immortality, but the catch is a
doozy: death is always scrambling collect to dark souls that need to be
controlled. Worse, if Death fails and the dark souls are left unchecked,
the world will come to an end.</p>
<p>Each Death begins normal enough, then comes to an end the usual way,
but a long-standing bargain between humanity and the grim reaper entails
an ancient ritual challenge: if a mortal can beat Death in any game,
they gain immortality. The trouble is, Death can’t be beat, unless Death
chooses to lose.</p>
<p>This has happened before and will inevitably happen again, because
mortals were never meant to live forever, and sooner or later, the
Reaper always tires of Reaping. It may take ten-thousand years or just
ten, but all god things must come to an end.</p>
<p>The downside is that this usually involves all of the collected dark
souls being released, which forces the new guy to pick up the slack,
lest the world end.</p>
<p>Dragons, monsters, creatures of legend, even dark and forgotten gods
with an ax to grind – they all have to be captured and contained.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the previous Reaper always sticks around for a while,
usually in the form of a talking skull, because someone has to teach the
new guy.</p>
<p>Each book in this series would bear only a tenuous connection to the
rest and each volume in it can stand alone, with no need to write them
in any particular order. Each would focus on a particular Reaper, though
it’s possible I may find I like any given character and give them an
extra volume or two.</p>
<p>The common elements of the series from Reaper to Reaper will consist
of each facing terrible calamities in order to save the world, requiring
some choice of vessel to contain the dark souls, which determines the
powers they manifest. However, all Reapers share the power to manipulate
and travel through time, which is essential for them to ferry the souls
of the living to the afterlife.</p>
<p>In addition, they also have to choose something or someone to serve
as their immortal companion. This is traditionally a horse, but there
are a great many options available, including motorcycles, cars, other
people, etc.</p>
<h3 id="chance-on-a-gamble">Chance on a Gamble</h3>
<p>A young man that lives by gambling dies in a motorcycle accident and
meets Death, who offers him a rare chance at immortality, through a game
of poker.</p>
<p>He wins and becomes Death, while Death crumbles to just a powerless
skull, which had been serving as the containment vessel.</p>
<p>After several women reject the opportunity, the young man chooses his
motorcycle as his companion, which becomes imbued with life, then
chooses to use his deck of cards and his dice to contain the souls. The
powers he gains are extremely strong, but subject to random chance and
tend to burn out after a while.</p>
<p>To challenge myself, I’ll come up with a random effects to attach to
the cards of a deck or the roll of the dice, then I’ll randomly choose
as required to determine which power he gets at any given time. During
the climax, he’ll finally find a way to stack the deck ahead of time,
rather than shuffling.</p>
<p>The more souls he gathers, the less time it will take for individual
cards to recharge after use.</p>
<h3 id="gunslingers-chance">Gunslinger’s Chance</h3>
<p>The Reaper of the Old West era began as an outlaw gunfighter, who
challenged death to a fast-draw contest of the sort favored in
Westerns.</p>
<p>Death loses on purpose and the outlaw finally finds out about the
fine print of the arrangement, forced to defend a world he hates,
because the alternative is worse.</p>
<p>The outlaw chooses his horse as his companion and his pistol as the
vessel. Each soul he captures will give him a unique power his bullets
can manifest, based on the defeated monster.</p>
<h3 id="chance-for-a-soldier">Chance for a Soldier</h3>
<p>A soldier that died on the battlefield during World War II defeats
Death in a bare knuckle bar fight.</p>
<p>The soldier chooses his best friend as a companion and their fists
serve to contain the souls. Each soul they collect will give them
greater durability and physical strength, eventually becoming like
super-heroes.</p>
<p>Together, they fight both dark souls and Nazis, but as they begin to
sway the outcome of the war, Reapers from other eras appear, to stop
them, lest they destroy the foundations of reality, by altering what was
meant to be.</p>
<p>The Reapers brawl like no battle that came before and whole cities
are decimated by the fighting.</p>
<h3 id="shinigami-of-chance">Shinigami of Chance</h3>
<p>At one point, the reaper was a Japanese samurai, who used his sword
as the the vessel and his armor as his companion. His armor became
imbued with life and the samurai came to think of it as being possessed
by a helpful, yet very clever fox yokai.</p>
<p>This one chose to think of himself as a shinigami, rather than a
Reaper.</p>
<h3 id="a-chance-insight">A Chance Insight</h3>
<p>The Reaper of this novel is a con artist that makes her living as a
fake psychic or medium.</p>
<p>She chooses her crystal ball as both the containment vessel and her
companion. She gains the rather unreliable power to gaze into the
future, while her crystal ball starts talking and can shape shift at her
command. She often uses it in the form of blunt instruments (like a
mace), since it’s made of extremely durable and heavy quartz.</p>
<h3 id="a-magical-chance">A Magical Chance</h3>
<p>The Reaper from the 1960’s is the lovely assistant of a magician and
also his wife.</p>
<p>She chooses her husband as her companion and makes magic itself the
containment vessel, transforming it into more than a mere slight-of-hand
trick.</p>
<h3 id="the-last-chance">The Last Chance</h3>
<p>The previous Reaper chooses poorly and gives his power to a man that
wishes to watch the world crumble, after losing his wife.</p>
<p>The Earth comes closer than ever to destruction as dark and evil
energy fills the world, fracturing both time and space, bringing Reapers
from the past into the present, each of them fighting to hold off the
catastrophe, despite the fact they lack the power, since they’re only
echoes of what was.</p>
<p>The new Reaper falls for one of the female Reapers of the past and
she convinces him to care, through small acts of romance. He chooses her
as his companion and together, they fight to end the catastrophe, but
the world may be too far-gone to save.</p>
<p>In a strange twist, the Reaper chooses his bond with his new wife as
his containment vessel and the attraction between them manifests as a
force that may be just enough to seal the cracks in space/time, or
possibly not…</p>
<p>This volume would likely be the last, a chance to bring the other
main characters together for one big adventure, while elements of the
real world, the future and even alternate histories mingle together.</p>

<title>The Wizard’s Scion</title>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-wizards-scion">The Wizard’s Scion</h1>
<p>This series follows the life of a great and powerful wizard’s son,
Levi Jacobs, as he grows from a teenage boy with almost no control over
his magic to a wizard of great power and reputation, that masters the
secrets of time travel.</p>
<p>The setting of this five volume series began as a relatively hard
science background, with only one big rubber science addition: some
faster than light technology that’s used for travel and communication.
Magic was largely unknown to everyone except the space pirate, until an
electrical engineer crash-landed on an “unexplored” planet that bore a
strange virus that gave him the powers of a wizard.</p>
<p>That electrical engineer who became a wizard was Levi’s father,
Zechariah. Zechariah is both directly and indirectly responsible for the
invention of many magi-tech devices, which mix magic and technology
together, using electricity to produce powerful spells beyond what any
wizard could do alone, leading to a setting in which wizards fly through
space in star ships that have the usual rubber science sci-fi bells and
whistles, including force fields and teleporters, as well as guns that
shoot magic spells.</p>
<h2 id="complete-series">The Complete Series</h2>
<blockquote>

Levi Jacobs always dreamed of being more like his father, the greatest
wizard in the world, but had no real understanding of what it would be
like if he got his wish.</p>
<p>Follow Levi’s journey from bumbling teen to a great hero, while the
young wizard learns to master magical powers that are initially
completely beyond him and barely under his control.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he’s forced to deal with a psychotic telepathic
swordswoman, an army of trolls, retrieving stolen star ships, a war with
forgotten monsters that no one believes in anymore, alien space pirates,
time travelers, a telepath that collects minds like shiny stones, a
necromancer that leads a ship of murderous goblins, rock monsters from
the invisible moon, a master of manipulating probability and a perilous
trip through the Greek Underworld, to have a conversation with The
Fates.</p>
<p>But it gets worse: Levi’s family always seems to be caught in the
middle of every disaster that comes along, leaving him with no choice
but to deal with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This omnibus edition includes all five volumes in the series (see
below) and will be published as an Ebook on April 11, 2025. The print
edition should soon be scheduled.</p>

freedom.</p>
<p><a href="https://owentyme.us/books/wizards-scion/troll-song.html">Troll Song</a> begins fully immersed in the
fantasy elements of the series, then slows begins introducing sci-fi
elements, before fully immersing the reader in a mixture of the two,
after a large forward skip in time, because the main characters got
frozen in ice for two-thousand years.</p>
<p>That’s when Lyra meets Levi, who frees her from the ice and becomes
her first modern friend.</p>

her demonic arch-nemesis, Vogerath, to the world. Following his magic
like a bloodhound, she finds herself inexplicably drawn to Vietnam, a
war zone.</p>
<p>With a pressing need to kill Vogerath, who claims to be the serpent
from the Garden of Eden, the half-demon Hunter is joined by her
detective partner, Clayton Simmons, and a powerful witch, Verda
Bagley.</p>
<p>It was meant to be a simple search and destroy mission, but nothing
in the jungles of Vietnam is ever simple and their plans go off the
rails the moment the Hunter sets foot on the ground. She’s overcome by
the magic of the jungle, which causes her to forget her humanity and
transform into a great, black cat with blue eyes!</p>
<p>Her team are forced to subdue her, to bring her back to her senses,
but the consequences of her instinct-driven actions leave them troubled,
because she killed a demon disguised as an American soldier and his best
friend wants revenge! As this fresh, unwanted conflict comes to a close,
the Hunter’s hands are reluctantly stained with human blood.</p>
<p>Vogerath’s jungle hideout is surrounded by soldiers and the raid
begins, but the Hunter’s plan continues to go wrong. After a unit of
tanks is overrun, the US military throws everything they’ve got at the
demons, inadvertently playing into Vogerath’s hands! The demon grows
stronger with each attack and awaits the power of a nuclear strike,
planning to use it to open a portal to Hell, so endless legions of
demons can march forth to conquer the Earth!</p>
<p>Will the Hunter and her friends stop Vogerath in time or will the
world be conquered by demons?</p>

the last place the Hunter wanted to go, but she’d made a vow to protect
humanity from demons, no matter where they appeared and in 1986, her
team of demon-slaying experts is called on to investigate. However, to
make things even worse, the Hunter’s team leader sends her into the camp
as an undercover operative, under the guise of a regular teen, despite
the fact that the half-demon girl being old enough to be the grandmother
of the kids at camp.</p>
<p>She’s soon caught up in the daily minutiae of camp, learning a few
new things along the way, while followed around like a puppy by a new
“friend”, a motor-mouthed girl that never shuts up. On the very first
day, she also acquires a trio of teenage foes in the form of some
valley-girl sisters from Los Angeles, who take every opportunity to
insult and plays pranks on her.</p>
<p>However, despite the innocent look of the place, danger lurks around
every corner, because the owner of the camp, Miss Macie Weber, is an
untrained witch, whose unknowing, haywire magic threatens to kill
everyone by summoning powerful and vengeful nature spirits, on top of
the demons already lurking among the humans at camp!</p>
<p>Will the Hunter find and slay the the demons or will the nature
spirits take offense at her mere presence, because she’s had the Jungle
Spirit stuck inside her head since 1972?</p>

<p>The half-demon girl who calls herself the Hunter never really
considered why she wanted all demons dead, but when she’s presented with
the one responsible for killing her parents, she loses all rationality,
going on the warpath.</p>
<p>It started with a crying widow and a stack of letters, leading the
Hunter’s private detective partner, Clayton Simmons, to investigate a
series of financial crimes. These threads all lead to the mysterious
Otto Vogerath, who’s rumored to be a mobster.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Hunter’s earliest memories begin coming into
focus, giving her clarity about the death of her parents at the hands of
the very same, because Vogerath isn’t just a mobster: he’s also a demon
that claims to be the serpent from the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>The duo and their allies are soon caught in a complex spider’s web of
mystery, involving conspiracies, murders, atom bombs and the demon’s
plot to tear a massive hole in reality, all of which revolves around the
life of the Hunter. Worse still, the demon requires the Hunter’s
cooperation for his plans to succeed and will do almost anything to get
it, repeatedly proving to her that everyone she cares for is in danger,
so long as she stands in the way of what he wants.</p>
<p>Will Simmons and the Hunter save the world or will the serpent
succeed in opening a portal to Hell, so legions of demons can march
forth to conquer the world?</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="starwitch">Starwitch</h1>
<p>Starwitch is volume one of <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/index.html">The Book of
Newts</a>, which follows the adventures and trials of a witch that owns
a magical book detailing many secrets of science, engineering, magic and
most particularly, space travel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><a

<a href="https://www.wattpad.com/story/386378071-starwitch">Read on
Wattpad</a></span> Home, safety, and a place to belong – they seem so
easy to find, at least for everyone but Amelia Blackwell and her
sisters, who run from accusations of witchcraft at every turn.</p>
<p>It started so simply, with a book. No one might have predicted that a
book apparently filled with pictures of newts might lead to so much
trouble, but <em>The Book of Newts</em> is no ordinary volume on
taxonomic detail of amphibians. The magic book reveals its true nature
only to Amelia, at the age of ten, teaching her mathematics, science and
engineering – subjects she would not otherwise have been exposed to.</p>
<p>Ironically, she and her sisters are accused of witchcraft for having
built a horseless carriage, because to the ignorant villagers, there’s
no difference between magic and science. They settle in a new land, only
to find the same breed of persecution.</p>
<p>In an unusual ray of hope, they’re told of a distant kingdom that
openly accepts witches, but shortly after they settle there, the light
at the end of the tunnel turns out to be an awful house fire surrounding
their gilded cage: they’re drafted into the local military, because
their new nation uses witches as living weapons.</p>
<p>The sisters accept the idea that peace will never be found on the
ground. Looking to the stars, Amelia builds a space vessel powered by
magic and steam, to carry them to a brighter future, hopefully without
the strife that’s always followed them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the people of the stars have their own worries: an
ancient, undead pirate queen, who consumes the souls of powerful witches
to extend her own life. The Dead Queen takes Amelia’s sisters and leaves
the magically-weak engineer to die, all as a sick form of sport.</p>
<p>Will Amelia survive long enough to overcome this greatest of all
threats and rescue her sisters, or will they become fuel to feed the
waning magic of a woman that should have been dead centuries before?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Starwitch</em> centers on the life of Amelia Blackwell, the
youngest of a trio of sisters and witches, who start out living on a
moon and eventually use magic to launch themselves into space, to escape
persecution for their witchcraft and various troublesome political
events.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they eventually encounter the Dead Queen, an ancient
undead pirate witch that consumes the magic and lives of other witches,
to extend her own existence.</p>
<p>The series begins with Amelia aboard her magic light sail ship,
<em>Starwitch</em>, just a few days after it was badly damaged and her
sisters were kidnapped by the Dead Queen, left with only enough
resources to follow the far larger ship.</p>
<p>That’s an intentional and cruel choice by the Dead Queen, because
Amelia’s magic is deemed too weak to consume. She instead left Amelia
for dead in the hopes of some sport, something the Dead Queen has done
to countless weak witches.</p>
<p>Amelia has just enough resources to attack, but not enough to limp to
safety, so unless she gets back either the mythril spell-core of her
ship or at least one of her sisters, she’s a dead woman.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-book-of-newts">The Book of Newts</h1>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/../../images/Cover-TheBookOfNewts.jpg" /></span> <em>The Book of
Newts</em> is a remarkable volume. Paradoxically, while The Book is
exceptionally magical, the information contained within is largely not.
It details every wonder of engineering, science and astronomy that’s
been discovered by its past owners, but this information is only visible
to its owner. To all others, it appears to be a thick volume describing
every variation of newt that has ever existed, in meticulous detail,
complete with hand-drawn illustrations.</p>
<p>The Book yearns for new knowledge. To that end, it inspires those
that own it to ever greater heights, taking them to the stars and
beyond, to reach their greatest potential, but nothing in life comes
without a price and its owners rarely foresee the balance coming
due.</p>
<p>While The Book is sometimes willing to wait, it’s never satisfied and
will always drive its owner to the next horizon, to the next discovery,
that it might grow a little thicker under the weight of new
knowledge.</p>
<p>Throughout history, The Book has been the driving factor behind many
things, particularly the colonization of the stars and terraforming of
many worlds, all to serve its insatiable hunger for more.</p>
<p>Witches and wizards are drawn to the magic of The Book, but woe
betide any that choose to stand in the way of the inevitable march of
progress, because The Book has a will of its own and a terrible power to
subtly bend its owner’s mind, leaving them just as hungry for more
knowledge.</p>
<p>At first, The Book seems like a blessing, but it might also be termed
a curse. That’s because it always seems to draw unwanted attention, but
never to itself, and its owners become magnets for trouble of all sorts.
Accusations of witchcraft often follow them, because science beyond the
wildest imaginings of the common man may as well be magic.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="plan">Release Plan</h2>
<p>Currently, the plan is to release this series in a manner that
resembles television, with episodes consisting of up to four chapters
and seasons about ten episodes long. Each novel of the series will be
analogous to a season of a show.</p>
<p>Each season will be initially free to read on <a
href="https://www.royalroad.com">Royal Road</a> and <a
href="https://www.wattpad.com">Wattpad</a>. When the next season is
ready to be posted, the old season will be published both in Ebook and
print editions, while the versions in their original, online locations
will become one or two episode teasers.</p>
<p>The first season is done and the first chapter was published on
Monday, January 6, 2025. The rest will follow a chapter at a time, every
Monday, Wednesday and Friday.</p>

href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/starwitch.html">Starwitch</a>.</p>
<p>The series begins with Amelia Blackwell, a witch with little magic
talent, but a keen mind, described by the previous owner of The Book as
a prodigy. She accepts ownership of it with curiosity and a voracious
desire to read all she can.</p>
<p>The Book soon gets Amelia and her two older sisters into all sorts of
trouble, because the depth of knowledge Amelia demonstrates breeds
jealousy, strife and accusations of witchcraft for all the wrong
reasons.</p>
<p>Eventually, Amelia constructs a vessel she names <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/starwitch.html">Starwitch</a> and the sisters flee the moon they
once called home, to seek peace among the stars. Instead, they find even
greater strife and a hostile pirate queen that consumes the souls of
witches to extend her own life.</p>

<em>Legacy of Newts</em> and will involve dealing with the consequences
of events from volume one.</p>
<p>Having defeated the pirate queen to rescue her sisters from serving
as fuel for that ancient witch’s life, Amelia flees, but the undead
witch is furious beyond measure and gives chase, determined to run them
down.</p>
<p>The sisters seek assistance from everyone they’ve befriended at every
port along the way, but no one has any desire to get between the sisters
and their powerful enemy.</p>
<p>There’s soon fighting in every corner of the star system, because the
Dead Queen’s lieutenants smell blood in the water. Things are poised to
go from bad to worse, because sometimes the devil you know is better
than the one waiting to fill the power vacuum…</p>

<em>The Next Horizon</em>. It will provide greater detail on The Book
and the way it interacts with Amelia.</p>
<p>After settling the matter of the pirates, Amelia and her sisters
enjoy a short time of peace, until she begins having dreams and visions
that reveal the way to travel from one star to the next, because The
Book has finally grown impatient.</p>
<p>Amelia initially resists, because she desires to return to the moon
she was born on, that she might reconnect with a man she fell in love
with, but The Book won’t leave her alone and becomes a source of great
frustration.</p>
<p>When the conflict comes to a head, The Book refuses to cooperate and
takes back the gifts it’s been quietly imparting. As a result, Amelia
discovers it has been bolstering her exceptional ability with
mathematics and piloting. Left to her own devices, the task of
navigating space becomes potentially deadly, because she can no longer
perform the required calculations in her head.</p>
<p>The journey home becomes perilous and tediously long, compared to
just days before, as everything that can get in the way does and she’s
forced to repeatedly check her math on paper, because her life is on the
line.</p>
<p>Just as Amelia and her sisters are struggling with that, they
encounter a duo of deadly witches they left behind and hoped never to
see again, who have since learned to fly through space and wish for a
helping of revenge.</p>
<p>Will Amelia survive long enough to reignite the love she once had, or
will she be forced to give up her greatest desire, just to satisfy The
Book?</p>

src="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/../../images/Cover-Witchhome.jpg" /></span> In volume four, titled
<em>Witchhome</em>, Amelia will arrive at a compromise with The Book
they can both live with.</p>
<p>Amelia builds a magic, flying city to serve as a home and place of
refuge while she explores space, a compromise between her desire to put
down roots and the ceaseless need of The Book to go further.</p>
<p>Her massive construction project soon draws attention from all over
the system. Witches and wizards flock to her cause, drawn like moths to
a flame by the potential. Dwarves first supply the resources required,
but soon see the allure of the project and lend a helping hand, that
they might find the same kind of refuge from prejudice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it isn’t all good news, and the locals of Amelia’s
home moon soon rise up, to burn the “cursed city of witches” to the
ground. To avoid all-out war, Amelia’s people are forced to launch
early, before even basic safety measures can be tested.</p>
<p>Will Amelia manage to have her cake and eat it too, or will all the
troubles she seeks to escape finally catch up to her? Will her people be
able to finish their work along the way, or will <em>Witchhome</em> come
apart before they can reach assistance?</p>

<em>Beyond the Horizon</em>, Amelia will finally begin exploring, as the
means to find a place her people can call home.</p>
<p>Amelia flies her magic city full of brave witches, wizards and
dwarves to unexplored space, for the sake of establishing a colony where
they won’t be persecuted for their magical talents.</p>
<p>They carry with them seeds and animals of every kind, with which to
make a new home, plus a population composed of every walk of life,
including every skill that might be required both along the way and at
their destination.</p>
<p>The journey is perilous beyond measure, with strange encounters
aplenty, including lethal space weather, aliens with unfathomable
motives and a hazardous encounter with a black hole.</p>
<p>Will Amelia’s people be able to find a world suitable for
terraforming and the construction of a new home, or will their journey
end with disaster, for over-reaching their grasp? Will Amelia be able to
resist naming that planet Witchworld?</p>

Royal Road</a></span> Nicole Jacobs is twenty years old and unsure what
direction to take in life, because the opportunities available to her
are too numerous and no one job fits all of her talents, but she passes
the time doing research on dragons. To that end, she hatches a dragon
egg, but in the midst of the harrowing work required, she dreams of the
ancient, magical City of Kurg, which yearns to be whole.</p>
<p>She soon discovers, based on a chance encounter with a small magic
item she’d been analyzing, that her mind has been dangerously
intertwined with that of the city, which spreads through her brain like
a disease, slowly taking over. At first, she’s able to keep it under
control by suppressing magic within her own head, but over time, it
begins breaking past the road blocks she desperately erects in its path
as it inches toward total control.</p>
<p>Seeking a cure, she’s forced to research the ancient city, while the
clock ticks down on her sanity and ultimately, her life. Meeting the
strange, stone men that made the city, the Ulkun, she finds they have
few answers for her, but suggest that if she locates the Architect of
Kurg, one of their own kind, he might be of some help. Unfortunately,
due to the fact he was trapped inside a small segment of the sealed city
for millions of years, alone, he’s quite insane, unhelpful and worse,
eventually becomes hostile, forming a plan for galactic domination.</p>
<p>Instead, Nicole seeks the Life Giver, the mysterious being that
created the Ulkun and ordered the construction of Kurg, while collecting
pieces of the city, in the hopes of attracting their attention.</p>
<p>Will Nicole find a cure, freeing herself from the clutches of Kurg,
or will she she lose control of her own mind, taken over by the magic
city? Will the Architect succeed at replacing everyone in the galaxy
with obedient, magically-animated drones with no will of their own or
will Nicole stop him?</p>

Royal Road</a></span> Nicole Jacobs is given a small, hexagonal coin for
her twentieth birthday, but during analysis of the strange, magic
trinket, she accidentally copies the magic item’s base spell into her
mind, where it rapidly expands beyond the original design, slowly
consuming her mind from the inside! Nicole reluctantly seeks out the
maker of the item, hoping to find a cure before it’s too late to save
her sanity.</p>

their original home due to the constant incursions of humans, the
fairies long ago retreated from Earth to an out of the way corner of the
galaxy to live in peace, but when humans accidentally stumble upon them,
they aren’t happy and this time, they’re not willing to give up their
home without fighting until either the extinction of themselves or the
human invaders!</p>
<p>However, nothing’s as it seems, because the humans only arrived as
the result of a series of accidents, having been forced to make an
unsafe faster-than-light jump through space to the nearest potentially
habitable system, which resulted in the destruction of their star ship!
With nowhere else to go and faced with the hostile locals, they
staunchly defend themselves against constant fey assault.</p>
<p>Two soldiers on opposite sides, pixie Commander Stargazer Candleflash
and human Sergeant Edwin Harris, find their fates forever entwined,
first by hatred and the desire for revenge, but then, as they crash
together in a rainforest full of danger, they’re forced to work
together, just to survive.</p>
<p>Will these two rivals, who have every reason to hate each other,
survive or will their bickering get them killed? Is it possible a
fragile peace can be forged from their own personal cease-fire or will
the doomsday weapons held by both sides be released, ensuring the
destruction of everyone?</p>

<p>On a distant planet tucked away in a barely explored region of the
galaxy, war breaks out between humans that are forced to land there and
the fairies that left Earth during World War II, because the human race
had become too violent to share a planet with.</p>
<p><em>Fey Fighters</em> introduces true fairies to the setting, who
will also be seen in volume three, where they’ll play a vital role
providing exposition and will also play a part in <em>The Great
Purpose</em>, due to the linked nature of both demons and fey.</p>

the fact that the City of Kurg is permanently bonded to her mind and
soul, Nicole seeks to collect all of the missing fragments of the
magical city, both on and off her home planet, soon coming into conflict
with rogue trolls, ancient monsters, aliens, gun-slinging snails,
monkeys with crossbows, giants and even fairies.</p>
<p><em>Collector of Kurg</em> will bring Nicole’s adopted mother,
Cha’da, into the series, as Nicole encounters her sailing the wilds of
the world’s ocean.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-BabaYagaLives.jpg" /></span> Baba Yaga started
out wanting to live a little longer, falling to the temptations of
necromancy to extend her life, gaining a mere decade or so with each
human soul she consumes. Eventually growing dissatisfied with such
meager fare, she turns her attention to consuming the souls of magical
creatures for the extra power they contain and her body slowly becomes
more magic than flesh, transforming her into a thaumavore.</p>
<p>However, with the rise of science and magical creatures of the galaxy
growing wise to her tricks, there’s precious little for her to eat. She
can’t afford the hefty price enchanted items sell for on the galactic
market and finds their weak magic unsatisfying, anyway, but she does
come across a rare and undervalued curio: one of the hexagonal coins
that make up the magical City of Kurg, an object so impossibly filled
with magic, it has the power to resist her every attempt to consume
it!</p>
<p>She seeks to unlock the hidden power of the coin, hoping to extend
her life until the end of time with its nearly limitless magic.
Unfortunately for her, not just anyone can access the magic of Kurg,
something only a city administrator can do. Learning this fact by
touching the mind of the coin, she seeks a conversation with Nicole, the
only available administrator.</p>
<p>Nicole’s quest to collect the missing pieces of the City of Kurg
brings her right to Baba Yaga’s doorstep and since their goals are
nothing alike and totally at odds, the meeting devolves into a magical
duel! War for ownership of the city follows, eventually leading to a
sprawling battle inside the legendary chicken-legged hut of Baba Yaga, a
magically-folded, mind-bending space that would give even M. C. Escher a
headache!</p>
<p>Will Nicole overcome the crone’s superior, time-tested spells or will
Nicole, as an extension of Kurg, become Baba Yaga’s living larder?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>

the city, including Levi’s old familiar, Inorath, because Nicole will
need information on Baba Yaga and many of them are even older than the
ancient witch.</p>

<em>Jigsaw City</em>, the true purpose of Kurg is revealed: it was
designed as a powerful weapon for fighting a war that’s as old as the
universe. The Life Giver is back, in need of Nicole and her city’s
power, while the Life Giver’s nemesis, The Void, attempts to invade the
Milky Way, to begin consuming everyone and everything there.</p>
<p><em>The Great Purpose</em> will bring the Hunter from <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../ashen-blades/index.html">Ashen Blades</a> to the city, to
combat a nearly limitless supply of demons, because they’ve finally

may have won the battle with demon-kind and The Void, but the cost is
extremely high: Nicole sacrifices her life for the success of their
crazy suicide mission and the Hunter finally reaches the limits of both
her demon and witch powers, with disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Nicole’s body is restored by automatic functions of the City of Kurg,
but her mind is shattered by re-birth as its living avatar. Lost,
confused and alone, will Nicole ever return to her home and those she
loves or will she forever wander a dying, parallel universe, seeking a
home she can’t even remember?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Hunter is also lost and alone, but in immediate peril.
She emerges from the spatial tear formed by The Void’s final kick at
thirty-thousand feet above a strange, alien planet, with absolutely no
idea where she is. Even worse, she’s lost the power of the elements and
been left to her own devices, totally unable to fly. Will she survive
the fall and find some way to get home or will she remain forever
lost?</p>

<p>Nicole discovers the fact that her memories were backed up by the
city before she was killed, but unlike her body, it was unable to fully
restore her mind.</p>
<p>Seeking to regain a greater measure of humanity, Nicole goes back to
collecting lost fragments of the City of Kurg, mostly for the sake of
restoring her memories.</p>
<p>This takes her beyond the galaxy she knows, to far-flung areas of the
multiverse, because when the ancient city broke up, parts of it left the
galaxy, while some few traveled to parallel universes.</p>

After the hornet’s nest Zechariah Jacobs kicked, by revealing the dark
secrets of the Northwestern Galactic Empire, all he wants is to get
home, but that may not be so easy. The Imperial Intelligence Core is out
for blood and more committed then ever to killing Zech, that they might
more reasonably claim his evidence of the colony they nuked is
false.</p>
<p>Zech and the crew of his star ship battle their way home by the skin
of their teeth, only for Zech to get some awful news: the Empire has
sent an entire fleet, which is packed to the gills with thermonuclear
ordnance and their primary mission is to glass the planet.</p>
<p>Zech and friends seek all the allies they can get, reaching out to
ogres and a remote village that turns out to be far more than meets the
eye, while an ex-pirate officer of his ship requests space pirate and
even alien aid. Meanwhile, Zech and the wizard he’s apprenticed to work
to mix magic and technology, to build weapons they hope will turn the
tide of war, including teleporters, energy shields and multifunction
guns that shoot spells, based on software.</p>
<p>Friendly ships arrive in orbit to help, but in too few numbers,
compared to the colossal fleet the Empire has fielded. Will Zech and his
friends survive the terrible fury of the Empire or will they lose
everything they love, including the very ground they stand on?</p>

<a href="https://books2read.com/SkyChildren">Store Links</a></span> In a
far-flung future where humans have colonized much of the galaxy,
Zechariah Jacobs is a colonist sent out by the Northwestern Empire,
aboard a star ship destined for the frontier, but there’s a rebellion on
board and he’s forced to scuttle the ship, on the captain’s orders.</p>
<p>Launching an escape pod, Zechariah lands alone, on an “unexplored”
planet. Knowing help is months, if not years away, he explores. He finds
plant and animal life remarkably similar to what his colony ship would
have seeded and shortly after encounters remarkably human-looking
natives, with pointed ears!</p>
<p>As he’s taught the local language, he learns the forest-dwelling
locals are elves and just beyond the hill is a village of dwarves. He’s
introduced to the dwarves and their leader, Winzon, who calls himself a
“history miner.” Winzon takes him to one of his best finds: an ancient
wrecked space fighter, that’s thousands of years old!</p>
<p>Zechariah accesses the black box, discovering his people used a
quarantine as an excuse to nuke one of their own colonies from orbit,
seeing awful images of the fighter gunning down the survivors, leaving
him wondering why!</p>
<p>Almost as if in answer, he catches an illness called “Mind Fire,”
which grants him strange, magic powers that defy science!</p>
<p>Using magic and technology, he helps Winzon’s search for more tech,
eventually discovering a star ship! Feeling disquieted by what they
know, they gather a crew for the ship, teach them using software left in
the ship’s computer, then go on a mission to visit one of the Empire’s
media hubs, to share all they know with the public.</p>
<p>Will they get the truth out or will the crew of the ship become the
most recent in a long line of victims snuffed out by the empire’s secret
cover-up operation?</p>

Peace and quiet to think and grieve, that’s all the Hunter wanted, but
between old enemies with agendas of their own, angry elemental spirits
and her own friends never quite knowing when to leave her be, that
elusive moment of quiet contemplation is always just out of reach.</p>
<p>The Hunter’s journey began with the loss of her best friend, the only
man that was ever a father figure to her, which reminds her of losing
the first real friend she ever had, because the two private detectives
had much in common and the similarities compound her grief.</p>
<p>She walks the surface of the Moon, for what better place could there
be to seek a quiet moment? Unfortunately, she soon faces an unexpected
demon that’s been trapped there for thousands of years. Next, she tries
a remote valley watched over by an ally, but the lonely woman pesters
the Hunter until she loses her temper and is forced to leave.</p>
<p>She wanders many remote and unusual corners of the world, always in
search of that moment of solitude, that she might reflect on the past,
but the arch-demon known as Wrath has taken a liking to her, and seeks
her hand in marriage. To that end, he posts a bounty for her capture and
the path to emotional healing becomes a frustrating battlefield.</p>
<p>She seeks the mythic last of all sanctuaries, but instead finds a
half-demon girl much like herself, and a quest to help the lonely child
connect with family.</p>
<p>In the midst of the Hunter’s busy and frenetic life, will she find a
moment to grieve her two best friends and learn to move on, or will all
of creation forever stand in the way?</p>

out in my head, but the trouble with this one is that I’m not sure how
to research Japan properly, to write it, because I want that to be the
setting. Ideally, I’d like to go there for a research trip, but I can’t
afford that. The next best alternative is interviewing someone that has
spent time there, but I don’t know anyone that has.</p>

<p>The last option is <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-hunts-gremlins">She Hunts

is, I prefer this one to come after the other two, because the novel

impatient and violent alien pirate lurks in orbit.</p>
<p>Far from friendly, the alien pirate is boiling with rage over several
massive blows to his pride at the hands of humanoids. Unable to kill
those responsible, instead he plots revenge on their child, Levi, and
everyone around him, to regain face in the eyes of his own kind, for

<p>Levi hated the monster from under the bed as a child, but when he
meets the creature as a young adult, he quickly learns nothing will be
the same in his life, ever again. The creature of darkness pleads for
his aid in a coming war and the young wizard reluctantly agrees, making
it his familiar.</p>
<p>Levi’s family and friends are soon caught up in a galaxy-wide war to
decide the fate of humanity and continually come face to face with
monsters straight out of myth and legend, including the dreaded Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse! The old gods and monsters humanity revered
before the rise of science and reason are angry over being ignored and
seek to force humanity to believe in them once more!</p>
<p>The young wizard’s allies find themselves in a unique position to
fight the supernatural creatures, since they’re gifted with magical
powers of their own, soon sparking a wave of resistance from the
governments of the galaxy, as they take the fight to the legends!</p>
<p>However, the battle isn’t easy, because the forgotten legends weren’t
idle over the millennia, having built an impressive manufacturing
facility that draws matter straight from a star to build warships at an
incredible rate, churning them out faster than humanity can deal with!
Worse yet, these ships have the very best in weaponry that both magic
and science can produce.</p>
<p>Will Levi and his family overcome the endless waves of disposable
warships or will the governments of the galaxy be crushed by the Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse, beginning an era of slavery under the heel
of their own forgotten legends?</p>

<p>Lyra never intended to cause the extinction of the troll race, but
when she uses the power of troll song to read the mind of a dwarf, she’s
forced to compare her life of abuse to that of a loving family.</p>
<p>Acting for the good of the world, she betrays her family and her race
by revealing the secrets of the trolls. For the sake of the dwarves,
Lyra kills her oldest sister, creating an opportunity for the dwarves to
defeat a disorganized army composed of their brothers.</p>
<p>The middle sister, Lyra’s childhood nemesis and personal tormentor,
Nicole, is furious beyond all rationality over her youngest sister’s
actions, determined to make Lyra pay, no matter the cost! Death would be
too good for Lyra, so Nicole seeks to telepathically destroy her mind,
instead!</p>
<p>Luring her sister into a trap, Lyra drops an entire mountain of ice
on their heads, intent on ending Nicole at the expense of her own
life!</p>
<p>They wake from their frozen sleep thousands of years later in a world
of wonders both scientific and magical. As Nicole escapes, the contest
begins anew and she gains control of a powerful star ship, intending to
use it as a platform for her vengeance!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lyra gains modern allies, including the influential family
and friends of a young wizard, Levi Jacobs.</p>
<p>Will Lyra defeat her murderous sister or will Nicole destroy Lyra’s
mind to fulfill her vow of vengeance? Will Lyra end the troll threat or
will Nicole become a scourge on the entire world, raiding and pillaging
as she sees fit?</p>

The Steel Wizard, Captain Levi Jacobs, is woken in the night by his
pregnant wife, with happy news their child is coming, but joy becomes
tragedy as she dies in childbirth. Reeling from this loss, he vows to
raise their daughter to be a strong hero, just like her mother, but even
that fleeting comfort is stolen from the bittersweet moment as the poor
infant struggles to breathe and dies in his arms!</p>
<p>Reeling at the loss, he staggers from one defeat to the next, slowly
losing everything else he cares about.</p>
<p>Finally, after a particularly traumatic defeat at the hands of a new
enemy, followed by a prolonged kidnapping involving the forced
administration of narcotics to make him complaint, he lies in the
infirmary of his ship, grief-stricken and struggling with addiction
withdrawal. Just when he’s at an all-time low, he’s offered a ray of
unusual hope, reminded that he once witnessed his future self travel
through time.</p>
<p>Armed with this memory, he focuses to unlock the secrets of temporal
magic, intent on undoing months of terrible events, only to find it’s
not so easy, because he has to fight to gain the approval of the Moirai,
better known as the Three Fates and speaking with them is no easy
task.</p>
<p>Can Levi change history or will all that he loves remain forever lost
in the past?</p>

hide the truth, including nuking their own colonies, from orbit. In

world, using the guise of a quarantine to corral the witnesses, for
extermination.</p>
<p>Learning these facts, Zecharaih vows to do something about it and
