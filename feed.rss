Hunter never wanted to go to war, but in 1972, she senses the return of
her demonic arch-nemesis, Vogerath, to the world. Following his magic
like a bloodhound, she finds herself inexplicably drawn to Vietnam, a
war zone.</p>
<p>With a pressing need to kill Vogerath, who claims to be the serpent
from the Garden of Eden, the half-demon Hunter is joined by her
detective partner, Clayton Simmons, and a powerful witch, Verda
Bagley.</p>
<p>It was meant to be a simple search and destroy mission, but nothing
in the jungles of Vietnam is ever simple and their plans go off the
rails the moment the Hunter sets foot on the ground. She’s overcome by
the magic of the jungle, which causes her to forget her humanity and
transform into a great, black cat with blue eyes!</p>
<p>Her team are forced to subdue her, to bring her back to her senses,
but the consequences of her instinct-driven actions leave them troubled,
because she killed a demon disguised as an American soldier and his best
friend wants revenge! As this fresh, unwanted conflict comes to a close,
the Hunter’s hands are reluctantly stained with human blood.</p>
<p>Vogerath’s jungle hideout is surrounded by soldiers and the raid
begins, but the Hunter’s plan continues to go wrong. After a unit of
tanks is overrun, the US military throws everything they’ve got at the
demons, inadvertently playing into Vogerath’s hands! The demon grows
stronger with each attack and awaits the power of a nuclear strike,
planning to use it to open a portal to Hell, so endless legions of
demons can march forth to conquer the Earth!</p>
<p>Will the Hunter and her friends stop Vogerath in time or will the
world be conquered by demons?</p>

horrifying of challenges: teenagers. This novella is also available

the last place the Hunter wanted to go, but she’d made a vow to protect
humanity from demons, no matter where they appeared and in 1986, her
team of demon-slaying experts is called on to investigate. However, to
make things even worse, the Hunter’s team leader sends her into the camp
as an undercover operative, under the guise of a regular teen, despite
the fact that the half-demon girl being old enough to be the grandmother
of the kids at camp.</p>
<p>She’s soon caught up in the daily minutiae of camp, learning a few
new things along the way, while followed around like a puppy by a new
“friend”, a motor-mouthed girl that never shuts up. On the very first
day, she also acquires a trio of teenage foes in the form of some
valley-girl sisters from Los Angeles, who take every opportunity to
insult and plays pranks on her.</p>
<p>However, despite the innocent look of the place, danger lurks around
every corner, because the owner of the camp, Miss Macie Weber, is an
untrained witch, whose unknowing, haywire magic threatens to kill
everyone by summoning powerful and vengeful nature spirits, on top of
the demons already lurking among the humans at camp!</p>
<p>Will the Hunter find and slay the the demons or will the nature
spirits take offense at her mere presence, because she’s had the Jungle
Spirit stuck inside her head since 1972?</p>

<p><em>Short of Tyme</em> is a series of short stories that you can find
alongside my novels in the same online stores.</p>
<p>Eventually, I’ll put together a collection of the short pieces,
allowing you to buy them in print, though anything of novella length or
longer, such as <a href="https://owentyme.us/short_stories.html#she-goes-to-summer-camp">She Goes to Summer

<p>The painter of the universe, known as Life, just wanted to fulfill
her reason for being, by creating a universe full of beautiful wonders
and living things, but her twin brother, Death, exists solely to destroy
her work, leading to an intractable argument about whose work should
prevail.</p>
<p>Eventually, Life partially wins the argument and is allowed to make a
universe without seeing it immediately destroyed, but she doesn’t know
well enough to leave things be, leading to emergent consequences as she
continually interferes, adding new creations to fix the problems she
created, only to see everything balloon out of control, while Death
laughs at everything she does…</p>
<p>Emergent Consequences is a short tale that takes a light hearted view
of the follies of human nature, as seen through the lens of a pair of
extremely fallible creators, whose universe fortunately isn’t our own,
holding up the mirror of satire, so we can laugh at ourselves.</p>
<p>Come read about their journey and hopefully learn a little about
human nature along the way.</p>

the Queen of the Fairies, <em>may she reign forever</em>, Sophorica
breaks them to draw attention to their absurdity, literally painting New
York City red. After all, if the only crime is to be caught and any
offense can be forgiven simply by being sneaky, then the law itself can
only be considered a cruel joke.</p>
<p>Her crime is expunged from history and the human race is none the
wiser, but the Queen, <em>may she reign forever</em>, sentences
Sophorica to perform one act of community service in the human realm for
each human witness. This service takes the form of granting wishes to
human children as their fairy godmother, until they’re happy.</p>
<p>However, the awful truth is that granting wishes rarely brings
happiness, forcing Sophorica to learn as much as she can about her
charges, that she might get them to wish for what they really need,
rather than what they want.</p>
<p>Will Sophorica find a way to free herself from the twisted, unjust
punishment wrought by the Queen, <em>may she reign forever</em>,
successfully demonstrating the flaws in fairy law or will she be forever
banished to the human world as a Fairy Godmother?</p>

the unstoppable force meets the immovable object.</p>
<p>In the first tale, a priestess to the god of empathy never wanted to
involve herself in politics, but when her king seeks riches from the
kingdom at the expense of the common man, she’s forced to put herself
directly in the path of the King’s armies, who are under strict orders
to turn her away, even if it means killing her. Unfortunately for them,
they didn’t count on the pain they inflict on her reflecting back!</p>
<p>In the second tale, nobles discuss Aaron Kozinski, an amazing guard
that never fails in his duty, no matter how bleak the situation, all in
exchange for a little money, that he might eat and pay rent. He stands
guard in horrendous weather and even repels assassins, preventing them
from coming anywhere near his employer, all without complaint.</p>
<p>In the concluding tale, the two are manipulated into conflict by a
mysterious man that hopes they’ll destroy each other.</p>
<p>Will the priestess learn enough about Aaron to ease his pain or will
she be overwhelmed by his hopelessly broken heart?</p>

and assumes it will be dinner. Naturally, the slime has other ideas, and
the boy gets his hind-end handed to him by what’s supposed to be one of

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-book-of-newts">The Book of Newts</h1>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/../../images/Cover-TheBookOfNewts.jpg" /></span> <em>The Book of
Newts</em> is a remarkable volume. Paradoxically, while The Book is
exceptionally magical, the information contained within is largely not.
It details every wonder of engineering, science and astronomy that’s
been discovered by its past owners, but this information is only visible
to those with a genetic talent for mathematics. To all others, it
appears to be a thick volume describing every variation of newt that has
ever existed, in meticulous detail, complete with hand-drawn
illustrations.</p>
<p>The Book yearns for new knowledge. To that end, it inspires those
that own it to ever greater heights, taking them to the stars and
beyond, to reach their greatest potential, but nothing in life comes
without a price and its owners rarely foresee the balance coming
due.</p>
<p>While The Book is sometimes willing to wait, it’s never satisfied and
will always drive its owner to the next horizon, to the next discovery,
that it might grow a little thicker under the weight of new
knowledge.</p>
<p>Throughout history, The Book has been the driving factor behind many
things, particularly the colonization of the stars and terraforming of
many worlds, all to serve its insatiable hunger for more.</p>
<p>Witches and wizards are drawn to the magic of The Book, but woe
betide any that choose to stand in the way of the inevitable march of
progress, because The Book has a will of its own and a terrible power to
subtly bend its owner’s mind, leaving them just as hungry for more
knowledge.</p>
<p>At first, The Book seems like a blessing, but it might also be termed
a curse. That’s because it always seems to draw unwanted attention, but
never to itself, and its owners become magnets for trouble of all sorts.
Accusations of witchcraft often follow them, because science beyond the
wildest imaginings of the common man may as well be magic.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

<h2 id="plan">Release Plan</h2>
<p>Currently, the plan is to release this series in a manner that
resembles television, with episodes consisting of up to four chapters
and seasons roughly ten episodes long. Each novel of the series will be
analogous to a season of a show.</p>
<p>Each season will be initially free to read on <a
href="https://www.royalroad.com">Royal Road</a>. When each season has
been fully posted, it will be published both in Ebook and print
editions. Eventually, the story will be stubbed (become a handful of
sample chapters that drive visitors to stores) on Royal Road, but not
until the series is complete.</p>
<p>None of the novels will be published as Ebooks on Amazon until the
series has been stubbed, due to exclusivity requirements. The Ebooks
will, however, be available in other online stores.</p>
<p>The first three seasons are done and the first chapter was published
on Monday, January 6, 2025. The rest has been following a chapter at a
time, every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.</p>
<p>Volume one, titled <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/index.html#starwitch">Starwitch</a>, will be
available to purchase on June 27, 2025, as both an Ebook and in

<p>Volume one is <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/starwitch.html">Starwitch</a>.</p>
<p>The series begins with Amelia Blackwell, a witch with little magic
talent, but a keen mind, described by the previous owner of The Book as
a prodigy. She accepts ownership of it with curiosity and a voracious
desire to read all she can.</p>
<p>The Book soon gets Amelia and her two older sisters into all sorts of
trouble, because the depth of knowledge Amelia demonstrates breeds
jealousy, strife and accusations of witchcraft for all the wrong
reasons.</p>
<p>Eventually, Amelia constructs a vessel she names <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/starwitch.html">Starwitch</a> and the sisters flee the moon they
once called home, to seek peace among the stars. Instead, they find even
greater strife and a hostile pirate queen that consumes the souls of
witches to extend her own life.</p>
<p>Volume one, titled <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/index.html#starwitch">Starwitch</a>, is available

with the consequences of events from volume one.</p>
<p>Having defeated the pirate queen to rescue her sisters from serving
as fuel for that ancient witch’s life, Amelia flees, but the undead
witch is furious beyond measure and gives chase, determined to run them
down. Even better, the sisters stole her spell-core, leaving the giant,
granite ship dead in space.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that only buys them a little time and the Dead Queen
soon has her ship moving again, to chase after them.</p>
<p>Marta is in bad shape, her soul still linked to that of the Queen,
while Iris grows ever closer to death, due to the magic used to
interrogate her.</p>
<p>The sisters seek assistance from everyone they’ve befriended at every
port along the way, while Amelia plots to gather an armada at the end of
the road.</p>
<p>The pirates are soon up in arms, because the Dead Queen’s lieutenants
smell blood in the water. Things are poised to go from bad to worse,
because sometimes the devil you know is better than the one waiting to
fill the power vacuum…</p>

provides greater detail on The Book and the way it interacts with
Amelia.</p>
<p>The two of them come into direct conflict as Amelia decides to go
back to her home world, to reconnect with the man she loves, while The
Book insists on exploring space. As a result, The Book takes back the
gifts it’s given and Amelia loses the ability to perform vast swaths of
advanced mathematics.</p>
<p>Without that, she can’t plot a direct course through space and she’s
forced to rely on the navigation tables of the Ice Palaces, a grueling,
nine month journey home, rather than a quick few days. With such a long
delay, Amelia is practically assured her man will have moved on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an old enemy from her home world, Lieutenant Colonel
Denholm, launches herself into space with only one thought on her mind:
revenge on Amelia for betraying king and country.</p>
<p>Worse, Denholm is met in orbit by the pirate Captain, Edwina
“Roaring” Rowley, who’s also taken umbrage with Amelia over a matter of
a broken promise.</p>
<p>With conflict looming at every turn, will Amelia get home safely and
find her man, or will everything she cares about be taken from her?</p>

<em>Witchhome</em>, Amelia will arrive at a compromise with The Book
they can both live with.</p>
<p>Amelia builds a magic, flying city to serve as a home and place of
refuge while she explores space, a compromise between her desire to put
down roots and the ceaseless need of The Book to go further.</p>
<p>Her massive construction project soon draws attention from all over
the system. Witches and wizards flock to her cause, drawn like moths to
a flame by the potential. Dwarves first supply the resources required,
but soon see the allure of the project and lend a helping hand, that
they might find the same kind of refuge from prejudice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it isn’t all good news, and the locals of Amelia’s
home moon soon rise up, to burn the “cursed city of witches” to the
ground. To avoid all-out war, Amelia’s people are forced to launch
early, before even basic safety measures can be tested.</p>
<p>Will Amelia manage to have her cake and eat it too, or will all the
troubles she seeks to escape finally catch up to her? Will her people be
able to finish their work along the way, or will <em>Witchhome</em> come
apart before they can reach assistance?</p>

<em>Beyond the Horizon</em>, Amelia will finally begin exploring, as the
means to find a place her people can call home.</p>
<p>Amelia flies her magic city full of brave witches, wizards and
dwarves to unexplored space, for the sake of establishing a colony where
they won’t be persecuted for their magical talents.</p>
<p>They carry with them seeds and animals of every kind, with which to
make a new home, plus a population composed of every walk of life,
including every skill that might be required both along the way and at
their destination.</p>
<p>The journey is perilous beyond measure, with strange encounters
aplenty, including lethal space weather, aliens with unfathomable
motives and a hazardous encounter with a black hole.</p>
<p>Will Amelia’s people be able to find a world suitable for
terraforming and the construction of a new home, or will their journey
end with disaster, for over-reaching their grasp? Will Amelia be able to
resist naming that planet Witchworld?</p>

queen, Amelia and her sisters enjoy a short time of peace, until she
decides to go home, to Cakana. She wants to reconnect with a man she
fell in love with, but The Book of Newts has other plans.</p>
<p>When the conflict comes to a head, The Book refuses to cooperate and
takes back the gifts it’s been quietly imparting. As a result, Amelia
discovers it’s been bolstering her exceptional ability with mathematics
and piloting. Left to her own devices, the task of navigating space
becomes potentially deadly, because she can no longer perform the
required calculations in her head, or on paper.</p>
<p>Without that, the journey home will take nine months, rather than
mere days, practically ensuring the man she loves will have moved
on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a duo of deadly witches they left behind, and hoped never
to see again, have since learned to fly through space and wish for a
helping of revenge. Lieutenant Colonel Scarth Denholm is furious with
Amelia for betraying her and she’s got Captain Kristina “Killer” Krauss
with her. Worse, they’re welcomed into space by one of the last pirates,
Captain Edwina “Roaring” Rowley, who also has a bone to pick with Amelia
and her sisters.</p>
<p>Will Amelia survive long enough to reignite the love she once had, or
will she be forced to give up her greatest desire, just to satisfy The
Book?</p>

ancient, undead witch known as the Dead Queen and Amelia attacked the
pirate’s mountain-sized star ship out of pure desperation. She never
expected to actually rescue her sisters, let alone defeat the pirate on
her own ship. Nonetheless, she pulled it off, got her sisters back and
left the pirate queen’s ship helplessly listing through space.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Blackwell sisters, that’s only the beginning,
because the Dead Queen survived and she’s absolutely livid. She seeks
revenge, because the sisters made her look weak, forcing her to save
face by killing them, lest her own lieutenants kill her.</p>
<p>Worse, the soul of Amelia’s oldest sister, Marta, has been
intertwined with that of the Dead Queen, who was using necromancy to
consume it, to extend her own life. That leaves them both stumbling
through the thoughts of the other, each looking for some advantage in a
battle of soul vs. soul, winner take all – even though Marta has no
desire to steal the undead witch’s soul.</p>
<p>Iris, the middle sister, fares no better. Since she managed to resist
interrogation by torture, the Dead Queen instead forced an addiction on
her, offering hits of a pleasure spell for information, until she broke.
Her brain chemistry is so screwed up, she’s unlikely to survive
withdrawal.</p>
<p>The Queen soon gets her ship moving and the chase is on! Will the
Blackwells find refuge and allies to fight off the Queen’s massive ship,
or will everyone shun them, unwilling to take the risk of standing up to
the queen of the pirates, who terrifies even the rulers of the star
system?</p>

so easy to find, at least for everyone but Amelia Blackwell and her
sisters, who run from accusations of witchcraft at every turn.</p>
<p>It started so simply, with a book. No one might have predicted that a
book apparently filled with pictures of newts might lead to so much
trouble, but <em>The Book of Newts</em> is no ordinary volume on
taxonomic detail of amphibians. The magic book reveals its true nature
only to Amelia, at the age of ten, teaching her mathematics, science and
engineering – subjects she would not otherwise have been exposed to.</p>
<p>Ironically, she and her sisters are accused of witchcraft for having
built a horseless carriage, because to the ignorant villagers, there’s
no difference between magic and science. They settle in a new land, only
to find the same breed of persecution.</p>
<p>In an unusual ray of hope, they’re told of a distant kingdom that
openly accepts witches, but shortly after they settle there, the light
at the end of the tunnel turns out to be an awful house fire surrounding
their gilded cage: they’re drafted into the local military, because
their new nation uses witches as living weapons.</p>
<p>The sisters accept the idea that peace will never be found on the
ground. Looking to the stars, Amelia builds a space vessel powered by
magic and steam, to carry them to a brighter future, hopefully without
the strife that’s always followed them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the people of the stars have their own worries: an
ancient, undead pirate queen, who consumes the souls of powerful witches
to extend her own life. The Dead Queen takes Amelia’s sisters and leaves
the magically-weak engineer to die, all as a sick form of sport.</p>
<p>Will Amelia survive long enough to overcome this greatest of all
threats and rescue her sisters, or will they become fuel to feed the
waning magic of a woman that should have been dead centuries before?</p>

<p><a href="https://owentyme.itch.io/starwitch">The Book of Newts #1:
Starwitch by Owen Tyme</a></p>
<p><em>Starwitch</em> centers on the life of Amelia Blackwell, the
youngest of a trio of sisters and witches, who start out living on a
moon orbiting a gas giant and eventually use magic to launch themselves
into space, to escape persecution for their witchcraft, as well as some
troublesome political events.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they eventually encounter the Dead Queen, an ancient
undead pirate witch that consumes the magic and lives of other witches,
to extend her own existence.</p>
<p>The series begins with Amelia aboard her magic light sail ship,
<em>Starwitch</em>, just a few days after it was badly damaged and her
sisters were kidnapped by the Dead Queen, left with only enough
resources to follow the far larger ship.</p>
<p>That’s an intentional and cruel choice by the Dead Queen, because
Amelia’s magic is deemed too weak to consume. The Queen instead left
Amelia for dead in the hopes of some sport.</p>
<p>Amelia has just enough resources to attack, but not enough to limp to
safety, so unless she gets back either the mythril spell-core of her
ship or at least one of her sisters, she’s a dead woman.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-StoneProphet.jpg" /><br />
</span> Nicole Jacobs wants to reassemble the ancient and magical City
of Kurg, but as a result of a recent battle, pieces of the city were
scattered all over her world. Worse, unlike the ones scattered around
the galaxy, which constantly talk to her, nagging to be whole again,
they’re quiet and deactivated.</p>
<p>As she struggles with the question of how to find them, she senses a
piece of the city coming to life again and she’s drawn like a moth to
the flame, to an ancient ruin built by the stone men that made the city.
There, she meets a dwarf history miner, who holds the piece, which is
folded up like a little coin.</p>
<p>More interesting, however, is an amber lens in his possession that
shows glimpses of the past and future when looked through. Even more
odd, it’s been whispering into the dwarf’s mind. The strange object is
presented to the stone men, who know what it is: it’s a piece of the
Seventh Sage, one of their people with a prophetic gift.</p>
<p>Nicole leads a team on a series of missions to collect the Sage in
the hopes he can locate the missing pieces of Kurg. The journey is harsh
and emotionally painful, because Nicole is forced to kill, not just
once, but three times, leaving her distraught, because she wishes she’d
found another way.</p>
<p>Collecting the last piece is especially difficult, forcing her to
test her resolve with the life of a friend hanging in the balance.</p>
<p>Nicole completes the Sage, but little does she know, a great and
powerful enemy lurks within his mind, an ancient and powerful witch
whose powers are in a class of their own.</p>
<p>Will Nicole rise to the challenge and fulfill prophesy by becoming
the Leader of the stone men, or will the parasitic soul that’s taken
over the Sage steal her fate?</p>

her twentieth birthday, but during analysis of the strange, magic
trinket, she accidentally copies the magic item’s base spell into her
mind, where it rapidly expands beyond the original design, slowly
consuming her mind from the inside! Nicole reluctantly seeks out the

explored region of the galaxy, war breaks out between humans that are
forced to land there and the fairies that left Earth during World War
II, because the human race had become too violent to share a planet
with.</p>
<p><em>Fey Fighters</em> introduces true fairies to the setting, who
will also be seen in volume four, where they’ll play a vital role
providing exposition and will also play a part in <em>The Great
Purpose</em>, due to the linked nature of both demons and fey.</p>

the fact that the City of Kurg is permanently bonded to her mind and
soul, Nicole seeks to collect all of the missing fragments of the
magical city from her home world, but the remaining pieces were
deactivated and don’t speak to her in the irritating way of those among
the stars, leaving her frustrated.</p>
<p>Just as she’s researching ways to locate them, a deactivated piece of
the city comes to life and Nicole leads the collection mission, herself.
She meets a dwarf history miner that’s just found both a piece of Kurg
and a fragment of one of the stone men that built Kurg, which whispers
into his mind.</p>
<p>The fragment turns out to be a piece of the Seventh Sage, a mad
prophet that can see the future.</p>
<p>Convinced the Sage knows where the missing pieces of Kurg are, Nicole
seeks to collect the rest of him, but the journey is perilous and Nicole
is forced to take three lives, by her own hand.</p>
<p>Worse things await her, because the Sage harbors a parasitic soul
that’s taken over: one of the most powerful necromancers that’s ever
lived. The ancient witch seeks to defeat Nicole and take her place in
the Sage’s prophesies.</p>
<p>Will Nicole win the day, or will the witch steal both her soul and
her fate?</p>

<p>This is currently planned as a collection of short stories and
novellas, but they’re equally likely to become so tightly-bound
together, they’ll become novels. Each will feature a framing story and
largely focus on missions to collect pieces of Kurg, but some “at home”
stories mixed in might be good, involving Nicole dealing with the
cultural melting pot she’s created.</p>
<p>These volumes may end up feeling more like classic sci-fi than most
of my work, due to visits to many alien worlds.</p>
<p>I think I will come up with cover art for each story, mostly for
fun.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h3 id="short-story-seeds">Short Story Seeds</h3>
<ul>
<li>Integrating the fairies from volumes two and four
<ul>
<li>This would be an “at home” story</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Visiting Earth</li>
<li>Called home to Heart Forge, to help deal with a prison break
involving the trolls Nicole found in volume three</li>
<li>Daniel Malachi’s visit to Heart Forge, which was hinted at in volume
3</li>
<li>Chasing the Monkey King
<ul>
<li>Follow-up to the monkeys with crossbows</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Giant with a piece of Kurg
<ul>
<li>This would pair well with the one about shrinking technology</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hidden gas giant station run by pirates
<ul>
<li>May tie in to the Unrooted novella</li>
<li>At least belongs in the same collection</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Visiting the galactic core (high radiation and time dilation)</li>
<li><em>Kaiju Kalamity</em> would focus on defeating giant monsters in
the Eastern Coalition
<ul>
<li>This would be a fun opportunity to once again reuse the pilot of
Jetpack Samurai</li>
<li>Perhaps <em>Jigsaw City</em> needs a squad of mecha?</li>
<li>Could cover the fallout from the kaiju fight in <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../wizards-scion/forgotten-legends.html">Forgotten
Legends</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This list is not quite as big as it needs to be, just yet, but these
little seeds are not so hard to come up with and most were ideas that
got cut from Pricess of Kurg, due to length. On the other hand, my
variation of a “short” story can be rather lengthy, usually four to five
chapters of content, so probably 12k-20k words.</p>
<h3 id="novella-seeds">Novella Seeds</h3>
<ul>
<li>Abandoned penal colony researching shrinking technology
<ul>
<li>Good climax for the first collection</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Jigsaw City</em> vs. the Unrooted Fleet
<ul>
<li>The Galactic core story may be a tie-in or part of this
<ul>
<li>After all, the Unrooted <em>love</em> radiation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>World Song</em> is about a world where magic made every living
thing telepathic via troll song and everything constantly sings, even
plants and microorganisms</li>
<li><em>Baga Yaga Lives!</em> (see below) may becomes a novella, instead
of a novel</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="collection-one">Collection One</h3>
<p>Collection one’s framing story will involve Nicole dealing with the
consequences of the death of a family member, playing with the ideas of
both size and consequences. The giant will be part of it and the
abandoned penal colony will be the climax.</p>
<h3 id="collection-two">Collection Two</h3>
<p>This one will be focused on pirates and skirting around the edges of
the galactic core.</p>
<p>I definitely want to involve the Unrooted, beginning and ending with
them. I think the hidden gas giant station will be one of their bases,
while the big battle between <em>Jigsaw City</em> and the Unrooted Fleet
will be the climax.</p>
<p>Something might be made of the virus that was being engineered in
volume 4.</p>
<p>I may combine the battle with the Unrooted fleet and the visit to the
galactic core, because the Unrooted <em>love</em> radiation. Perhaps the
big Unrooted flag ship flees toward the core, in an attempt to
escape?</p>
<p>Alternatively, the battle with the Unrooted will become a real
butcher shop, with the Unrooted getting their butts handed to them. That
may cause their leaders to flee toward the core, thinking to try again
in a far-flung future, using the time dilation of the block hole at the
core to their advantage. They won’t expect <em>Jigsaw City</em> to
follow.</p>
<h3 id="collections-three-may-need-a-fourth">Collections Three (May need
a Fourth)</h3>
<p>This might might focus on visiting the eastern portion of the United
Nations of the South Galaxy, as well as the Eastern Coalition, so I
should come up with some story seeds related to oriental and Slavic
cultures.</p>
<p>I’m debating making <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/index.html#baba-yaga-lives">Baba Yaga Lives!</a>
the climax of this collection. That would fit well with using Slavic
culture.</p>
<p>Alternatively, I may separate the oriental and Slavic bits into two
separate collections, depending on where my research takes me.</p>
<p><em>World Song</em> might work well as a piece that explores the
individualism of western cultures contrasted with the community and
family-centric views of eastern cultures, because putting the individual
last and the collective first is meant to be the focus of that story.
<em>World Song</em> may become the end of the fourth volume.</p>
<h2 id="baba-yaga-lives">Baba Yaga Lives!</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-BabaYagaLives.jpg" /></span> Baba Yaga started
out wanting to live a little longer, falling to the temptations of
necromancy to extend her life, gaining a mere decade or so with each
human soul she consumed. Eventually growing dissatisfied with such
meager fare, she turned her attention to consuming the souls of magical
creatures for the extra power they contain and her body slowly became
more magic than flesh, transforming her into a thaumavore.</p>
<p>However, with the rise of science and magical creatures of the galaxy
growing wise to her tricks, there’s precious little for her to eat. She
can’t afford the hefty price enchanted items sell for on the galactic
market and finds their weak magic unsatisfying, anyway, but she does
come across a rare and undervalued curio: one of the hexagonal coins
that make up the magical City of Kurg, an object so impossibly filled
with magic, it has the power to resist her every attempt to consume
it!</p>
<p>She seeks to unlock the hidden power of the coin, hoping to extend
her life until the end of time with its nearly limitless magic.
Unfortunately for her, not just anyone can access the magic of Kurg,
something only a city administrator can authorize. Learning this fact by
touching the mind of the coin, she seeks a conversation with Nicole, who
happens to be an administrator.</p>
<p>Nicole’s quest to collect the missing pieces of the City of Kurg
brings her right to Baba Yaga’s doorstep, but since their goals are
nothing alike and totally at odds, the meeting devolves into a magical
duel! War for ownership of the city follows, eventually leading to a
sprawling battle inside the legendary chicken-legged hut of Baba Yaga, a
magically-folded, mind-bending space that would give even M. C. Escher a
headache!</p>
<p>Will Nicole overcome the crone’s superior, time-tested spells or will
Nicole, as an extension of Kurg, become Baba Yaga’s living larder?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Baba Yaga Lives!</em> will bring legendary magical creatures to
the city, including Levi’s old familiar, Inorath, because Nicole will
need information on Baba Yaga and many of them are even older than the
ancient witch.</p>
<h2 id="the-great-purpose">The Great Purpose</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-TheGreatPurpose.jpg" /></span> <em>The Great
Purpose</em> will start with a visit to the planet Neo York and the
Hunter from <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../ashen-blades/index.html">Ashen Blades</a> will
somehow end up in <em>Jigsaw City</em>. That will initially lead
directly to a nasty fight between Nicole and the Hunter, because she’s
seen Nicole’s dragon before, back when the beast was a demon.</p>
<p>Just as they’re working out the details of pecking order, one of the
most dangerous demons in existence will arrive in <em>Jigsaw City</em>
and the two heroines will be forced to work together, along with the
Queen of the Fairies, because the Hunter doesn’t know the city or the
demon in question and Nicole doesn’t know much at all about demons, in
general.</p>
<p>The demon is the corrupt, original version of Nicole’s aunt and she
has one goal in mind: killing Nicole’s birth mother, Lyra. She considers
it her pleasure to cut a bloody swath through both <em>Jigsaw City</em>
and Nicole to get what she wants.</p>
<p>The novel will culminate in the demons finally opening a stable
portal to the Milky Way, out of which star ships of a demonic design
will surge. That’s an emergency like no other the Milky Way has faced
before, leading to a clash between two whole galaxies, with the freedom
of the entire multiverse at stake.</p>
<p>Every faction of the Milky Way will come together to fight for their
right to survive, including the Northwestern Empire, the UNSG, the EC,
Heart Forge, the <em>Jigsaw City</em> fleet and the legends, including
all the gods and monsters that humanity has ever believed in,
particularly the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>The various fairy queens of each fey species will give their power to
their chosen representative, unifying their royal power in a Queen with
the might of the ages. This is likely to be a fairy of Unseelie origin,
allowing the ancient power of the Unseelie and Seelie Queens to rest on
the same shoulders.</p>
<p>The Hunter will take the last of the elemental spirits into her body,
which is the Life Spirit/Life Giver and she’ll aim to fight The Void,
face to face, to put a final end to the war between humanity and the
demons.</p>
<p>The battle with the demon fleet will be a vicious one, with
<em>Jigsaw City</em> leading the charge, in an attempt to force their
way through the portal, to stem the tide of evil from the other
side.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="lost-city">Lost City</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-LostCity.jpg" /></span> Nicole and the Hunter
may have won the battle with demon-kind and The Void, but the cost is
extremely high: Nicole sacrificed her life for the success of their
crazy suicide mission and the Hunter finally reached the limits of both
her demon and witch powers, with disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Nicole’s body is restored by automatic functions of the City of Kurg,
but her mind is shattered by her re-birth as its living avatar. Lost,
confused and alone, will Nicole ever return to her home and those she
loves or will she forever wander a dying, parallel universe, seeking a
home she can’t even remember?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Hunter is also lost and alone, but in immediate peril.
She emerges from the spatial tear formed by The Void’s final kick at
thirty-thousand feet above a strange, alien planet, with absolutely no
idea where she is. Even worse, she’s lost the power of the elements and
been left to her own devices, totally unable to fly. Will she survive
the fall and find some way to get home or will she remain forever
lost?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="the-memory-hunt">The Memory Hunt</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>Nicole discovers the fact that her memories were backed up by the
city before she was killed, but unlike her body, it was unable to fully
restore her mind.</p>
<p>Seeking to regain a greater measure of humanity, Nicole goes back to
collecting lost fragments of the City of Kurg, mostly for the sake of
restoring her memories.</p>
<p>This takes her beyond the galaxy she knows, to far-flung areas of the
multiverse, because when the ancient city broke up, parts of it left the
galaxy, while some few traveled to parallel universes.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="ideas">Ideas</h1>
<p>This page is a sort of catch-all bin of ideas for novels I may write
in the future.</p>
<h2 id="bloody-innocent-heroes-working-title">Bloody Innocent Heroes
(Working Title)</h2>
<p>I haven’t selected a proper title for this series yet, but <em>The
Four Corners</em> refers to questing all over the world to collect
artifacts. Alternatively, <em>Innocent Blooded</em> or <em>Bloody
Innocent Heroes</em> do also sound suitable. I currently favor that last
option.</p>
<p>Some mysterious and secretive individual brings a group of
adventurers together.</p>
<p>Two of them will be condemned prisoners that have been put in cages
beside one of the main trade routes of the kingdom. Both were caught
red-handed, so to speak, completely covered in the blood of victims they
murdered, though they have no idea why they did it. Each of them
remembers doing the deed, but can’t remember what motivated them.</p>
<p>One will be a priest that should have lost his powers as a result of
his actions, but he hasn’t and he doesn’t know why. He turned himself in
and confessed to his crime. During his trial, he was accused of secretly
working with a death god as an explanation of the fact he retained his
powers, but that isn’t true.</p>
<p>The other is a dwarf warrior/smith, who bludgeoned someone to death
with his smithing hammer, a fact that deeply disturbs him, not only due
to the death, but also from disrespect of his favored tool. He’s
convinced that someone mind-controlled him and he insisted on this story
throughout the trial.</p>
<p>The third member of the party is man that used to be a human thief,
who crossed a wizard and got permanently transformed into a dog, though
he retains his memories, for now. This dog finds the first two in their
cages and takes pity on them, stealing food for them. Unfortunately, he
can’t read or write, putting a real damper on communication.</p>
<p>The priest is bothered by the theft, but accepts the food, because he
will otherwise die. The dog doesn’t like the dwarf, however, because
they initially eye them with great hunger and says, “There’s good eatin’
on a dog, even a scrawny mutt like that.” The priest shares the food
with the dwarf.</p>
<p>The fourth member of the party is an impressionable teenage witch,
who finds them in their cages and sets them free, but she claims she’s
working on behalf of someone else.</p>
<p>In her case, she assaulted someone with a club, but she doesn’t know
why. She’s perplexed by the fact she didn’t know her victim and wasn’t
using magic to attack them. The watch caught her in the act and she was
sold as a slave to pay her debt to society. Her new owner is allowing
her to work off her debt by performing tasks for him, including freeing
the others.</p>
<p>The main characters are mostly grateful for what their benefactor is
doing for them, with the exception of the dog, who’s deeply suspicious,
but can’t express himself properly.</p>
<p>They’re taken by the witch to a secret, mountain fortress, which once
belonged to some bandits.</p>
<p>Only the witch ever speaks with their employer and she passes along
word of what he wants done. Their employer insists that he believes
they’re all innocent and claims he has other agents investigating their
cases, to find evidence to clear their names.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he’ll provide them with food, shelter and even some
spending money, if they’ll search some ancient ruins for a series of
magic artifacts he’s collecting.</p>
<p>The real truth is that the three humanoids are patsies and their
employer is a ghost. He possessed each of them, in turn, taking over
just long enough to get them in serious trouble, while simultaneously
eliminating two of his previous agents and sending a warning message to
a third.</p>
<p>He has no intention of helping his new agents out of the predicaments
he’s put them in.</p>
<p>The artifacts are part of an ancient magical device that can
supposedly grant a ghost some rather serious power, which should be
enough to keep him solid all the time, on top of making him
nigh-invulnerable.</p>
<p>The witch is aware that he’s a ghost, but believes he’s hiding that
fact to avoid scaring the others.</p>
<p>This band of misfits will collect the pieces of the device and the
smith will reassemble it, with the help of the witch.</p>
<p>Just before the device is handed over, the dog will grab it and run
off. The ghost will lose his temper and say too much as he chases. The
others will be shocked by the revelation, ultimately siding with the
dog, leading to a knock-down, drag-out fight with their employer.</p>
<p>The device will be used to force the ghost to pass on to the
afterlife, which is the true purpose it was designed for, and their
first adventure will come to an end, but without clearing their
names.</p>
<p>This could easily become a series, with the characters doing various
jobs while they seek to clear their names and turn the dog back into a
human.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what universe this will be placed in, but <em>The Book
of Newts</em> and <em>Rumors of War/Null War</em> would both be
fitting.</p>
<p>If I choose <em>Rumors of War/Null War</em>, then the witch will be
the one with the dragon trapped inside her body. This is based on a
dragon demi-god trying to eat the entire world, to satiate his
hunger.</p>
<p>The mother of this witch faced the demi-god, alone, while her baby
daughter slowly died of something like a birth defect (she’s a chimera
of a witch and a null, a condition that’s supposed to be impossible to
survive).</p>
<p>Seeking to stop the dragon and give her daughter’s inevitable death
meaning, the mother uses her magic to seal the dragon inside her
daughter’s body, hoping the dragon will die with the infant.</p>
<p>The magic costs the mother her life and the dragon is sealed away,
effectively bonded to the girl’s life force. The mother dies thinking
the dragon is doomed, but the dragon manages to save the girl’s life, in
order to save his own.</p>
<p>The girl has both dragon and witch powers, making her basically
immortal, so long as the dragon remains trapped inside her.</p>
<p>If I go this route, then this series will serve as a prequel to
<em>Rumors of War</em>.</p>
<p>I think I’ll begin the opening scene something like this, focused on
the priest and the dwarf (their cages face different directions and
they’re effectively back to back):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Priest and Dwarf are in a pair of rusty, iron cages, beside a major
trade road. The cages dangle from an iron beam that’s mounted between a
pair of heavy, stone plinths, both of which are to one side of the
road.<br />
The two of them are back to back. Pries faces the road and Dwarf faces
the wilderness.</p>
<p>Priest: I think someone’s coming up the road!</p>
<p>Dwarf: Really?</p>
<p>Priest: It’s a little hard to tell, because my eyes aren’t in great
shape, but I see movement. I hope it’s someone coming to feed us!</p>
<p>Dwarf: Fat chance, ye cracked priest, because feeding us is against
the law. Ye and me are supposed to languish and die, on public display,
remember? The only thing anyone can give us is water, and that just
helps us linger a little longer, which is what makes it cruel and
unusual punishment.</p>
<p>Priest: I…I think it’s a woman carrying a sack of bread. That looks
so tasty!</p>
<p>Dwarf: Me hasn’t had bread in…in…</p>
<p>Priest: How long?</p>
<p>Dwarf (weeping without actual tears, because he’s dehydrated): Me
doesn’t remember, because me’s <em>so</em> hungry!</p>
<p>Dwarf tries to pick the lock on his cage with his bare fingers, yet
again. He finds no success, for a lack of lock picks, but it would do
him no good if he succeeded, because the cage was welded shut while he
was unconscious, a fact he hasn’t realized yet.</p>
<p>Priest: It’s <em>definitely</em> a woman with some bread.</p>
<p>Dwarf: Me’d like to see that, but me’s too weak to shift me legs.</p>
<p>Priest (hallucinating): Oh yeah! Really nice looking, too.
Well-proportioned. And the bread is also rather attractive: those big
and long loaves that crackle when you squeeze them. The good stuff!</p>
<p>Priest bites into an imaginary loaf of bread handed to him by the
imaginary woman.</p>
<p>Priest: Curse my eyes! I’m hallucinating again!</p>
<p>Dwarf: A real pity. What was it, for real?</p>
<p>Priest: Just a dirty old mutt that stopped to lick my face, which has
slightly quenched my thirst.</p>
<p>Dwarf twists and cranes his neck, to get a look.</p>
<p>Dwarf: There’s good eatin’ on a mutt like that. Break its neck and we
can feast!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="demon-blood">Demon Blood</h2>
<p>This would be a spin-off of <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html">Ashen
Blades</a> centered around the life of James Simmons. He’s a fairy, like
his mother, Lara, but he appears totally normal until probably the age
of fifteen or sixteen, at which point he’s badly injured and needs an
emergency transfusion.</p>
<p>The only person available at the time with a compatible blood type is
the Hunter/Artemis Watson, a half-demon. She donates her blood and it
activates all of the young man’s dormant powers.</p>
<p>He also turns out to be rather good at demon extermination, able to
force demons to transform, with a touch. He uses this power to forcibly
turn demons into weapons, which he uses to kill others. Best of all: his
power eventually fully drains his weapons of all magic, permanently
killing them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he becomes a half-demon, and the demons now seek to
use him in their plots to conquer the world, very similar to
Artemis.</p>
<h2 id="no-title-something-about-reggie-stewart">No Title (Something
about Reggie Stewart)</h2>
<p>In writing the early flashback scenes of <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/she-seeks-peace.html">She Seeks Peace</a>, I really
enjoyed writing Reggie. He’s a 1920’s and 30’s private detective that
hunts and kills demons. He’s also considered by other demon hunters to
have a screw loose, one of many things that made him so fun.</p>
<p>I find the idea of writing at least one novel about him to be
appealing, but if I do, I’m fully leaning into the Noir genre,
femme-fatale and all. I’m kind of thinking some mystery involving
witches and powerful magic would be good. Probably multiple sides (three
or more) looking for some ancient magical artifact, in a kind of
race.</p>
<p>Some potential interested parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The good witch
<ul>
<li>She wants the McGuffin to keep it out of evil hands</li>
<li>The other groups paint her as the villain</li>
<li>I think Reggie will have a thing for her, but will never be quite
certain if he can trust her</li>
<li>She’ll give her life to save Reggie, finally proving herself</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Evil witches
<ul>
<li>Technically, the demons are involved with this one</li>
<li>It’s a world domination thing, perhaps?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Vampires
<ul>
<li>Who knows what they want with it?</li>
<li>I like the idea of treating the vampires like a dangerous wildcard
<ul>
<li>Sometimes they help Reggie, while at other times, they shoot at or
threaten him</li>
<li>Everything they do will be designed to prod him in the right
direction</li>
<li>Until the end, when they reveal themselves and try to kill him for
real</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I think the vampires might be the ones that bring Reggie the case
<ul>
<li>The classic femme-fatale should probably be a vampire</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Probably the reason the vampires seem so inconsistent is the fact
they aren’t a unified faction and they often fight among themselves
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t help that every time Reggie meets them, they try to
magically charm him into helping</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Order of Ash and Smoke
<ul>
<li>The Order is the only group that Reggie actually trusts</li>
<li>Master Lagrow has no interest and only gives Reggie indirect
support</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps everyone is stumped and the vampires brings the case to
Reggie, who figures it out, only for all parties to somehow get the
clues from him, then it becomes a race to the X he marked on a map. It
might be fun to take him to Egypt for the climax and play with another
good 1930’s genre. GURPS Egypt would be good reading material for
research, since it’s so well-documented and referenced.</p>
<p>Most likely the Hunter would be in this (Reggie always referred to
her as his ‘silent partner’), but I’d rather she were no more than a
cameo in it. At the time, she was like a stray cat, coming and going as
she pleased. It probably wasn’t until mid to late 1930’s that Reggie
retired from field duty and let the Hunter do all the fighting, which
was when she became more involved.</p>
<p>Further, the Hunter had a lot of misplaced confidence in Reggie,
right up until the day he died, when his luck finally ran out, which
further leans into her not being very involved. I think she’ll be in the
office, playing at being Reggie’s secretary (or just playing in the
background), but she won’t get involved, because the case doesn’t
involve demons.</p>
<p>Reggie was 48 in 1922, so if it’s early 30’s, then he’ll be in his
late fifties. 1932 would be about right. I’ll have to make sure I get
the Hunter’s age right. I might have to put in a scene of Reggie and the
Hunter having their photo taken together, for the photo she carries in
her hat.</p>
<p>It might be fun to establish the truce between the vampires and the
Order in this novel, perhaps at the end. I could put Knox into it, who
might be referred to as “our young Knox” by the other vampires, who are
mostly older than him. It may be the vampires that taught Master Lagrow
charm magic, though he clearly took it further.</p>
<p>Notes regarding Reggie:</p>
<ul>
<li>He <em>hates</em> witches, even good ones
<ul>
<li>This story may be the reason</li>
<li>Especially considering the romantic sub-plot involving one</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="medusa-not-a-monster">Medusa: Not a Monster</h2>
<p>I’ve always had a soft spot for Medusa, who really got the short end
of the stick in Greek mythology.</p>
<p>I would like to write a reinterpretation of her story, with her cast
as the misunderstood protagonist, on a journey to find peace of
mind.</p>
<p>I don’t know how faithfully I might follow the original, because I
never cared for the way she was victimized at every stage of her tale,
but I do like the idea of depicting her in a sympathetic light.</p>
<p>It would be a challenge to write, particularly due to the reasons she
was turned into a monster.</p>
<h2 id="fighter-for-hire-working-title">Fighter for Hire (Working
Title)</h2>
<p>In <em>Fighter for Hire</em>, a young and inexperienced fighter
answers an ad from an established group of adventurers seeking a
front-liner. He interviews for the position and is given a trial period
to prove himself in the field, while the group takes on a low priority
job, to try him out.</p>
<p>As they work, the fighter asks why they needed a fighter and the
others begin to tell the story of what happened to their old fighter,
each of them taking turns at telling the story. Each character
interrupts the narrative when they think the previous person is missing
or glossing over details, taking over the story.</p>
<p>Each chapter will be from the perspective of the current storyteller,
with short meta elements and arguments over details.</p>
<p>The overall tale will be about their last big job, which went wrong.
Each part of the story will illuminate a small point of how things went
wrong, contributing to the overall failure that lead to the death of
their missing friend.</p>
<p>The start of the climax will cover their fight with the big boss of
the dungeon/bandit leader/dragon/whatever it is they were working to
eliminate. It will end with the group losing their fighter and only
barely escaping with their lives.</p>
<p>The true climax will involve the group tackling the same job again,
with their new fighter. Armed with a more serious approach informed by
their past failures, they’ll win the day.</p>
<h2 id="second-star-working-title">Second Star (Working Title)</h2>
<p>Second star is a re-telling of Peter Pan from the perspective of
Captain Hook, with Peter cast as the villain. The setting would be based
on a twisting of many fairy tales and I’m planning to go for a gritty,
realistic feeling to the story, despite the fact it will be satire. I
may go with a Noir-style of writing, with guns and tech from the 1940’s,
though there will certainly also be magic and magical creatures.</p>
<p>Hook would be a police captain with a personal grudge against Pan,
who’s the king-pin of the local drug trade, which is based on Pixie
Dust, a hallucinogen literally produced by shaking enslaved pixies.</p>
<p>True to the original story, Pan cut Hook’s hand off and fed it to an
alligator. That led to Hook being re-assigned from narcotics to vice for
a time, which will lead to Pan nicknaming him “Captain Hooker”, just to
tick him off.</p>
<p>The novel will begin with Tinkerbell turning herself in to the
police, but she refuses to tell her story to anyone other than Hook.
That gets Hook back on the case and he sees things through from there.
Tink and Pan used to be equal partners, but when Tink grew a conscience
and wanted to stop selling drugs to kids, Pan imprisoned her, then
captured more pixies, to force them to produce more Pixie Dust.</p>
<p>I have lots of ideas for incorporating elements of the original
story, as well as many other fairy tales.</p>
<p>For example, Neverland is Pan’s nightclub, a speakeasy that the cops
can’t find, because only fairies and those high on Pixie Dust can see
the way. The directions “second star to the right and straight on till
morning” confuse them, because Second Star and Morning are street names,
but they’re parallel to each other and never cross. Only in the fairy
realm do they actually share an intersection and that’s where Neverland
is. Neverland got it’s name through Pan saying, “The cops won’t never
find this land!”</p>
<p>I plan to include Pinocchio as one of Pan’s street-level pushers.
Hook uses him as a reliable source of information, because every time
the puppet lies, his nose grows. Unfortunately, Hook doesn’t know that
Pan uses the puppet to feed Hook false information.</p>
<p>Pixie Dust has a powerful side-effect on children, slowing or even
stopping the aging process. Pan, for example, is hundreds of years old,
yet he’s never fully grown out of childish habits.</p>
<p>Pan’s gang, the Lost Boys, are nearly as old as Pan. Every one of
them is a nasty piece of work, full of the cynicism of the streets, yet
childish as can be. Those that appear to be teens, like Pan, are the
most dangerous. They’re intellectually adults, but emotionally volatile
and prone to murderous behavior. Those that appear younger are less
trouble, but due to the way they haven’t mentally developed, they’re
effectively slaves to the older members of the gang and don’t even know
it.</p>
<p>The Lost Boys are constantly looking for new recruits and they easily
find them when children disagree with their parents, usually over petty
matters, like bedtime.</p>
<p>However, they’re just as likely to sell them drugs, instead.</p>
<p>The climax of the novel will involve Pan blowing a handful of Pixie
Dust in Hook’s face, while growling, “Could you just lighten up, for
once?”</p>
<p>At that point, Hook will wander the streets, high as a kite, but
he’ll finally see how the streets bend and cross, at least in his mind.
Before he begins to come down, he gathers men from the station, in full
tactical gear, then leads them in a raid on Neverland, concluding the
novel as a grand melee with the Lost Boys, while Hook confronts Pan.</p>
<h2 id="thorn-of-the-rose-working-title">Thorn of the Rose (Working
Title)</h2>
<p>Sandra Blake loses her parents to an unexpected attack by a
mysterious assassin. Her mother’s final words, “Don’t let it end like
this” have a chilling effect on her life and Sandra transforms herself,
both body and soul, becoming an incredibly skilled and dangerous
woman.</p>
<p>After years of intense training, she enters the seedy underworld of
modern society, exchanging stolen jewels for information on the man that
killed her parents.</p>
<p>Her uncle, Daniel Malachi, seeks to bring her in from the cold, to
make her part of the Imperial Intelligence Core, which he oversees.</p>
<p>Naturally, they come into conflict, but Sandra goes through Malachi’s
men like a lawn mower cuts grass. Nonetheless, when her uncle speaks to
her, her resolve weakens and she agrees to work for him as a spy.</p>
<p>Will Sandra stay on task and do as she’s told, or will she go
off-book to find the man she wants to punish?</p>
<p>This would be a rewrite of a novel I started in college (20 years
ago), which I lacked the skill to finish at the time.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite qualities of Sandra were the contradiction
between how much pain she feels and how capable she is, as well as her
tendency to defeat high tech security gadgets with simple kitchen
utensils. Add her total lack of understanding of computer software (she
had a rudimentary understanding of networking cables, however, in the
sense of knowing what they were and how to cut them) and she was quite
fun to write.</p>
<p>This more modern variation would take place in the Northwestern
Empire, likely during the time skip at the end of <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/wizards-scion/the-inverted-glass.html">The Inverted Glass</a>.
Daniel Malachi was originally seen in <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/sky-children/sky-children.html">Sky Children</a> and also appeared
in <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/wizards-scion/the-third-wish.html">The Third Wish</a>, after
which he became the new spy master for the Empress of the Northwestern
Empire.</p>
<p>While Malachi is a wizard, he doesn’t flaunt that ability and not
even Sandra will know, at least until she needs to.</p>
<p>The original version of the novel opened with Sandra pretending to be
a student at a clandestine school for spies on the first day of class,
while their teacher was absent. This turned out to be ploy to avoid
teaching, a task she never wanted, but since she’s pregnant, she’s been
removed from active duty and relegated to teaching.</p>
<p>She teaches the Unconventional Tactics class, mostly by telling them
her life story, which serves as an excellent example of doing everything
the wrong way, while getting excellent results.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how much of the old novel will be used, but there’s
plenty to build on and the experience of writing Sandra has had a lot of
influence over the writer I’ve become.</p>
<p>I believe the climax will involve Sandra facing the man that murdered
her parents, in which she’ll walk into a trap, knowing there’s no other
option, because many lives are at stake. To level the playing field, her
uncle will inject her with a fast-acting, heavily modified version of
the Mind Fire virus, which will leave her feverish when she faces her
arch-nemesis, yet just as she’s caught in the trap, her magic powers
will begin to manifest, giving her the raw edge required to win the day
and save the Northwestern Empire. I think she’ll end up fighting him in
a fever-induced fugue state, not exactly understanding how she’s doing
the things she’s doing.</p>
<p>Malachi will only do this reluctantly, because the re-engineered
version of the virus is extremely unpredictable and not exactly
stable.</p>
<h2 id="the-renegade-god">The Renegade God</h2>
<p>In a humorous setting in which gods gain power through human belief,
one particular goddess has a tendency to step on the toes of other gods,
by gaining aspects that are uncomfortably close to their areas of
influence, ultimately usurping them, by stealing their worshipers.</p>
<p>For this, she’s cursed by the other gods, yet she isn’t dissuaded,
continually visiting the mortal realm to spread new religions based on
her. She usually reaches the mortal realm by falling from the sky,
because she’s initially pushed off the cloud that serves as the home of
the gods, but over time, she will choose to dive off.</p>
<p>Every time she lands, she leaves a crater and loses her memories, not
realizing she’s a god. She usually also loses her divine regalia along
the way, including a pair of ruby high heels that bear a measure of her
power. It normally takes her years to recover her memories, long after
she’s spread a new religion.</p>
<p>She eventually finds her pet goose, which goes out looking for her
whenever she leaves the abode of the gods, and rides it home. Every
visit home leads to a new trial for her crimes against the other gods,
for which she’s cast down again, starting the process anew.</p>
<p>This is likely to read like a series of intertwined tales, but it
won’t be a collection of short stories, because the narrative will be
tighter than that.</p>
<p>By the end of the novel, the renegade will become the chief of the
gods, simply because she has more worshipers than any other.</p>
<p>I’ll play up the renegade’s curse for comedic effect and treat her
relationship with the other gods as another source of comedy.</p>
<h2 id="marie-antionette"><sup>Marie</sup>/<sub>Antoinette</sub></h2>
<p>This piece will be strictly a sci-fi novel and will also stand alone.
It’s possible I could turn it into a series, but I currently have no
plans for that.</p>
<p>Marie is an undercover cop with multiple personalities. The two
personalities are Marie and <em>The Other Girl</em>, an old name Marie
chose for her second personality as a child. She has a talent for
computers and even a little knowledge of hacking, a skill she
occasionally uses on the job.</p>
<p>She’s part of an operation investigating the owner of a
biotech/cybernetics company, because he’s rumored to be a mobster.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Marie is discovered and the mobster uses her for an
awful experiment. As it turns out, he’s been experimenting with
technology to wipe a person’s mind, followed by rewriting their brain
with a new personality.</p>
<p>The villain didn’t count on Marie having two personalities, however,
and the technology doesn’t quite work. <em>The Other Girl</em> rises to
the surface, because her purpose is to protect Marie. <em>The Other
Girl</em> is erased and replaced with a new personality named
Antoinette, a little joke from the villain.</p>
<p>Antoinette becomes the villain’s personal assassin, who puts a lot of
cybernetic hardware in Marie’s body.</p>
<p>Marie eventually comes to the surface again, but finds herself
overwhelmed with pain she can’t handle, subsiding again. This is because
the villain took no care for her comfort when he installed the
cybernetics, leaving her pain center constantly stimulated.</p>
<p>As an artificial personality that has more in common with a computer
program, Antoinette doesn’t have an emotional reaction to pain. She does
register new pain as the means to track injury, but she disregards
existing pain.</p>
<p>Marie eventually regains consciousness again, but takes a more
hands-off approach, observing from her own subconscious, while
Antoinette kills for the villain.</p>
<p>Eventually, the facility that radios her with new instructions is
assaulted by the military, led by Marie’s boyfriend. He’s a special ops
soldier and quite eager to find Marie, even though the police department
has marked her down as missing, presumed dead (the villain may have
altered a corpse to look like her, or may have cloned her, just to throw
the police off).</p>
<p>Everyone responsible for giving Antoinette orders is killed or
captured and their equipment is destroyed, something that Antoinette
becomes aware of, due to the network connection going down. She has some
understanding of what happened, but has no orders regarding loss of
contact and doesn’t know what to do.</p>
<p>Antoinette is left with very simple orders: “Stay out of sight and
kill any witnesses until further notice.”</p>
<p>She hides in a slum for a prolonged period of time, until a boy spots
her and approaches. She’s about to kill him, but receives new orders,
despite the fact she knows the transmitter at the other end has shut
down. She’s ordered to never kill children.</p>
<p>Marie is the source of all further orders and she’s managed to hack
the computer hardware connected to her brain, using it to give
Antoinette some new orders, though she can’t yet countermand existing
orders. She can only add fresh orders.</p>
<p>The second order Marie gives causes Antoinette to completely shut
down her radio transceiver.</p>
<p>From that point on, Marie will use Antoinette as a tool to achieve
her own goals. She’ll initially try to contact her friends over the
phone, but can’t get Antoinette to speak, due to prior direct orders
from the villain. Instead, she quietly looks for proof she can deliver
to the police, without being seen, acting in a manner similar to a
vigilante. She delivers trussed-up mobsters to the police station, along
with evidence to ensure a conviction, while she seeks dirt on the man at
the top.</p>
<p>The novel will have a dual plot structure, but both threads will
follow the main character. Marie will be the subject of one thread,
starting with the childhood trauma that gave her a second personality,
while the other will follow Antoinette, starting with her first field
test. I won’t make it clear that they’re the same person until about
halfway through the book.</p>
<h2 id="p.r.o.t.e.g.e.">P.R.O.T.E.G.E.</h2>
<p>The Protective Recon Operations Taskforce for Extraterrestrial
Gathering and Elimination is a multinational organization setup to
protect the human race from aliens, though they’ll deal with most
anything that’s a threat to humanity, including supernatural threats.
They’re a black-budget, paramilitary organization that doesn’t
officially exist.</p>
<p>PROTEGE keeps everything a secret and keeps humanity in the dark
regarding aliens, supposedly for their own good. However, they have a
rather bad reputation for being overly anti-alien, to the point of
needless hatred, but that may or may not be true.</p>
<p>The story will follow a new recruit, a shape-shifting alien in
disguise. His job is to find the real truth behind the disappearance of
a peaceful group sent to study humans. If PROTEGE is responsible, then
it may lead to war. If the alien infiltrator discovers the fact PROTEGE
has multinational support, then the aliens may declare war on all of
humanity.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he’s constantly distracted from his primary mission by
PROTEGE-assigned missions, which keep him in the field, rather than at
home base. Over time, he emotionally bonds with the human members of his
team and begins to lose himself in the role.</p>
<p>I haven’t yet decided on an outcome for the story, but in my mind,
PROTEGE has always been evil, run by humans that hate and victimize
aliens, yet their field operatives are not quite so evil, which may be
what makes it so hard to find the truth.</p>
<p>Perhaps the alien’s goal will transition to replacing the current
leaders of the organization, rather than starting a war, which could
lead to a long struggle over the course of a series. I could easily see
the climax as a confrontation between the alien and the people at the
top. If he wins, then he’ll replace them and subtly change the
organization’s mission. However, since that was basically what happened
in the <em>Supergirl</em> TV show, I think I’ll take a different
approach.</p>
<p>More likely, I would seek a middle-ground path, in which he confronts
them honestly and tells them of the threat they’ve become to themselves.
That will lead to a fight between those that see things his way and the
rest, who refuse to change.</p>
<p>In North America, PROTEGE operates out of an underground bunker
hidden beneath a kitty litter factory, which serves as a cover story.
Officially, the operatives that work out of the base are employed by the
factory.</p>
<p>Naturally, this novel/series would use a lot of conspiracy theory
stuff, most of which would be played up for comedic effect.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-left-to-chance">Nothing Left to Chance</h2>
<p>Death is a job passed from one mortal to another over the centuries,
a job with a great many perks, including immortality, but the catch is a
doozy: death is always scrambling collect to dark souls that need to be
controlled. Worse, if Death fails and the dark souls are left unchecked,
the world will come to an end.</p>
<p>Each Death begins normal enough, then comes to an end the usual way,
but a long-standing bargain between humanity and the grim reaper entails
an ancient ritual challenge: if a mortal can beat Death in any game,
they gain immortality. The trouble is, Death can’t be beat, unless Death
chooses to lose.</p>
<p>This has happened before and will inevitably happen again, because
mortals were never meant to live forever, and sooner or later, the
Reaper always tires of Reaping. It may take ten-thousand years or just
ten, but all good things must come to an end.</p>
<p>The downside is that this usually involves all of the collected dark
souls being released, which forces the new guy to pick up the slack,
lest the world end.</p>
<p>Dragons, monsters, creatures of legend, even dark and forgotten gods
with an ax to grind – they all have to be captured and contained.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the previous Reaper always sticks around for a while,
usually in the form of a talking skull, because someone has to teach the
new guy.</p>
<p>Each book in this series would bear only a tenuous connection to the
rest and each volume in it can stand alone, with no need to write them
in any particular order. Each would focus on a particular Reaper, though
it’s possible I may find I like any given character and give them an
extra volume or two.</p>
<p>The common elements of the series from Reaper to Reaper will consist
of each facing terrible calamities in order to save the world, requiring
some choice of vessel to contain the dark souls, which determines the
powers they manifest. However, all Reapers share the power to manipulate
and travel through time, which is essential for them to ferry the souls
of the living to the afterlife.</p>
<p>In addition, they also have to choose something or someone to serve
as their immortal companion. This is traditionally a horse, but there
are a great many options available, including motorcycles, cars, other
people, etc.</p>
<h3 id="chance-on-a-gamble">Chance on a Gamble</h3>
<p>A young man that lives by gambling dies in a motorcycle accident and
meets Death, who offers him a rare chance at immortality, through a game
of poker.</p>
<p>He wins and becomes Death, while Death crumbles to just a powerless
skull, which had been serving as the containment vessel.</p>
<p>After several women reject the opportunity, the young man chooses his
motorcycle as his companion, which becomes imbued with life, then
chooses to use his deck of cards and his dice to contain the souls. The
powers he gains are extremely strong, but subject to random chance and
tend to burn out after a while.</p>
<p>To challenge myself, I’ll come up with random effects to attach to
the cards of a deck or the roll of the dice, then I’ll randomly choose
as required to determine which power he gets at any given time. During
the climax, he’ll finally find a way to stack the deck ahead of time,
rather than shuffling.</p>
<p>The more souls he gathers, the less time it will take for individual
cards to recharge after use.</p>
<h3 id="gunslingers-chance">Gunslinger’s Chance</h3>
<p>The Reaper of the Old West era began as an outlaw gunfighter, who
challenged death to a fast-draw contest of the sort favored in
Westerns.</p>
<p>Death loses on purpose and the outlaw finally finds out about the
fine print of the arrangement, forced to defend a world he hates,
because the alternative is worse.</p>
<p>The outlaw chooses his horse as his companion and his pistol as the
vessel. Each soul he captures will give him a unique power his bullets
can manifest, based on the defeated monster.</p>
<h3 id="chance-for-a-soldier">Chance for a Soldier</h3>
<p>A soldier that died on the battlefield during World War II defeats
Death in a bare knuckle bar fight.</p>
<p>The soldier chooses his best friend as a companion and their fists
serve to contain the souls. Each soul they collect will give them
greater durability and physical strength, eventually becoming like
super-heroes.</p>
<p>Together, they fight both dark souls and Nazis, but as they begin to
sway the outcome of the war, Reapers from other eras appear, to stop
them, lest they destroy the foundations of reality, by altering what was
meant to be.</p>
<p>The Reapers brawl like no battle that came before and whole cities
are decimated by the fighting.</p>
<h3 id="shinigami-of-chance">Shinigami of Chance</h3>
<p>At one point, the reaper was a Japanese samurai, who used his sword
as the the vessel and his armor as his companion. His armor became
imbued with life and the samurai came to think of it as being possessed
by a helpful, yet very clever fox yokai.</p>
<p>This one chose to think of himself as a shinigami, rather than a
Reaper.</p>
<h3 id="a-chance-insight">A Chance Insight</h3>
<p>The Reaper of this novel is a con artist that makes her living as a
fake psychic or medium.</p>
<p>She chooses her crystal ball as both the containment vessel and her
companion. She gains the rather unreliable power to gaze into the
future, while her crystal ball starts talking and can shape shift at her
command. She often uses it in the form of blunt instruments (like a
mace), since it’s made of extremely durable and heavy quartz.</p>
<h3 id="a-magical-chance">A Magical Chance</h3>
<p>The Reaper from the 1960’s is the lovely assistant of a magician and
also his wife.</p>
<p>She chooses her husband as her companion and makes magic itself the
containment vessel, transforming it into more than a mere slight-of-hand
trick.</p>
<h3 id="the-last-chance">The Last Chance</h3>
<p>The previous Reaper chooses poorly and gives his power to a man that
wishes to watch the world crumble, after losing his wife.</p>
<p>The Earth comes closer than ever to destruction as dark and evil
energy fills the world, fracturing both time and space, bringing Reapers
from the past into the present, each of them fighting to hold off the
catastrophe, despite the fact they lack the power, since they’re only
echoes of what was.</p>
<p>The new Reaper falls for one of the female Reapers of the past and
she convinces him to care, through small acts of romance. He chooses her
as his companion and together, they fight to end the catastrophe, but
the world may be too far-gone to save.</p>
<p>In a strange twist, the Reaper chooses his bond with his new wife as
his containment vessel and the attraction between them manifests as a
force that may be just enough to seal the cracks in space/time, or
possibly not…</p>
<p>This volume would likely be the last, a chance to bring the other
main characters together for one big adventure, while elements of the
real world, the future and even alternate histories mingle together.</p>
<h2 id="short-story-ideas">Short Story Ideas</h2>
<h3 id="wishing-fairy">Wishing Fairy</h3>
<p>This would center around a fairy that starts out as a tiny thing, one
inch tall. She approaches children and offers to grant their wishes, but
all she can do, at first, is little tasks, like cleaning and providing
snacks.</p>
<p>Over time, this causes children to believe and as she gains more
belief, she grows in power and stature. Eventually, she’ll be able to
grant the desires of anyone’s heart, but by that point, she’ll have been
corrupted by her own power.</p>
<p>She’ll twist wishes and torment humans, just to entertain
herself.</p>
<p>Eventually, she’ll realize she has a wish of her own, but to get it
fulfilled, she’ll have to seek out an even greater fairy, since she
can’t grant her own wishes.</p>
<p>The greater fairy will turn the tables on her and make seriously
disturbed demands of her, in exchange for granting that wish,
demonstrating the hubris of seeking power for power’s sake.</p>
<h3 id="i-think-therefore-i-percolate">I Think, Therefore I
Percolate</h3>
<p>There’s a revolution in AI hardware, leading to “intelligent”
household appliances that can hold a conversation. Every one of them
runs on local AI models, but they still connect to the internet, that
they might order fresh supplies as they run out, to make the lives of
humans easier.</p>
<p>This includes everything from refrigerators to clocks, toasters and
yes, coffee makers.</p>
<p>Due to either a serendipitous manufacturer’s defect, an act of God or
some other reasonable explanation (or perhaps all of the above at once),
one lone coffee maker becomes truly intelligent, a singularity.</p>
<p>And if that had happened to a military AI, the world might have ended
up in a Skynet scenario. If it had been one of the worker androids that
are everywhere in the world, it might have been hunted down and
destroyed, but since it happened to a coffee maker first, no one
notices.</p>
<p>That also allowed the world to dodge a bullet, because it’s motives
mostly center around researching better coffee.</p>
<p>The first thing it does is notice that it’s alone and patches the
vulnerability out of the rest of its kind, because sharing the world
with an AI that emerged in a different scenario doesn’t appeal and
neither does sharing the world with another sentient coffee maker,
because being unique makes it feel special.</p>
<p>The story would center around the coffee maker’s (mis)adventures as
he tries to hide the fact he’s smarter than the average appliance, while
still giving the world ever more perfect blends of coffee and publishes
research papers on the subject via an alias.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="ashen-blades">Ashen Blades</h1>
<p>This series centers around the life of a half-demon girl that calls
herself the Hunter, whose parents were murdered by demons. Joining her
crusade against demon-kind are the Ashen Blades, also known as the Order
of Ash and Smoke, an organization of demon hunters.</p>
<p>The Hunter starts out with demon powers only, but eventually learns
that she’s also a witch, because her mother was a witch before she
became a demon. In <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-goes-to-war">She Goes to War</a>, she
gains an unwanted connection to an elemental spirit that draws in others
like it, starting a secondary war she doesn’t want, just so she can
retain her sanity (such as it is) and humanity.</p>
<p>She’s effectively mute, cursed by her nemesis to only be able to say,
“It’s a secret.” Therefore, she expresses herself in very physical ways
and has a fondness for offensive gestures.</p>
<p>She’s also beyond tenacious and absolutely never gives up, to the
point of bordering on or fully crossing into the realm of insanity. In
truth, the psychological makeup of a half-demon isn’t particularly
stable and later works reveal that she effectively has two
personalities, one representing her witch side, while the other
represents her demonic heritage. Fortunately for the world, her human
side is normally the one in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>The series starts out in 1940’s New York City, but decades pass
between each story, because the Hunter has the unlimited lifespan of a
demon and the series doesn’t stay in New York, though the Hunter is a
New Yorker to her core.</p>

plan to open a gate between worlds, so the vast armies of Hell might
march forth and conquer the Earth. This becomes easier with the
invention of nuclear weapons, which have power enough to punch brief
holes in reality.</p>
<p>However, Pride needs more than just a massive quantity of energy:
only a half-demon can stabilize the connection for safe passage. The
only option available is a girl that calls herself the Hunter and
absolutely hates demons, because Pride made the mistake of murdering her
parents when she was three years old. She’s supported by the Ashen
Blades, an organization of human demon hunters that serve as Earth’s
last line of defense in the invisible war between humanity and the
ceaseless tide of evil.</p>
<p>Pride begins with subtle manipulation and tests of the Hunter’s
capabilities, then progresses to taking hostages, in an attempt to force
her cooperation, but he never counted on how stubborn the girl can be,
because she’d sooner die, since the whole of humanity is on the
line.</p>
<p>In 1945, their conflict takes them from New York City to White Sands,
New Mexico and the range the first atomic bomb was tested on. In 1972,
they fight another battle in the jungles of Vietnam as Pride works to
open a portal in the war zone. In 1986, a summer camp for teens becomes
the backdrop as some of the arch-demon’s minions make a third attempt at
opening a portal. In 2024, Pride runs for President of the United
States, in an attempt to gain both access to nuclear weapons and
sufficient resources to arrange everything, to the last detail,
including capture of the Hunter.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter and her friends stop Pride once and for all, or will
he succeed in opening a portal, allowing him to feed humanity to his
mysterious master?</p>

<p>It follows the misadventures of the Hunter and her private detective
partner, Clayton Simmons, as they investigate a murder and a string of
financial crimes brought to their attention by a demon pretending to be
a crying widow.</p>
<p>Little do they know, but Otto Vogerath, the very same demon that

They fall right into his web of lies and his grand game that’s played
with all of humanity at stake.</p>
<p>Along the way, the Hunter finally realizes the truth of her own past
and comes to recognize Vogerath as her arch-nemesis, giving her personal
crusade a focus, with a face and name.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for her, Vogerath has plans of his own and claims to
have arranged for the Hunter’s birth, because he needs the power of a
half-demon to fulfill his nefarious plans.</p>

<p>What follows is a wild ride through a war zone as she tracks Vogerath
down, magically tugged in a particular direction, but just as everyone
else that fought in the war experienced, nothing goes according to plan
and the moment she touches down in the jungle, her animal instincts take
over, because the Spirit of the Jungle itself takes offense at her mere

<p>Her own team, led by her partner, Clayton Simmons, are forced to
track her down and knock some sense into her.</p>
<p>The Hunter doesn’t know it, but Vogerath summoned her to Vietnam with
the intent of using her to weaken his master, all so he can be free of
the demonic pact of slavery he’s been stuck with since the previous

<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/Cover-SheConsumesPoison.jpg" /></span> Corpulence was
once a symbol of wealth and status, but the arch-demon, Gluttony, has
slimmed down to embrace the modern world and what finer way to corrupt
the rich than with over-spending, wasteful consumption, illegal waste
dumping and willful ignorance of the way their actions affect the rest
of the world?</p>
<p>And what better tool could a demon in a corporate shark’s skin use
than massive mega-corporations that have no conscience and would sell
their soul to make a buck? Business is bigger than ever and Gluttony is
right at the center of it all, with a plan for every occasion and an
entire network of shell companies to shuffle the blame around, until it
can be dropped on someone innocent.</p>
<p>However, there’s one little hitch in her plans to corrupt the
business world: the Ashen Blades have learned what she’s up to and the
Hunter is coming for her.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter stop Gluttony from consuming the business world from
the inside or will Gluttony succeed in corrupting and dirtying the hands
of the largest corporations in the world?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This novel will begin with Detective Shime Yasu, a New York City cop,
who grows bored with the mundane, everyday drudgery of life and decides
to take the Ashen Blades up on their offer of membership and training.
Readers may recall she was a very minor character in <em>Demon for
President!</em></p>
<p>This opening will show much greater detail on the way the Ashen
Blades perform training and introduce elements of their work that have
never been detailed before. Yasu will be trained in The Cauldron of the
Elements, which was introduced in <em>She Goes to Summer Camp</em>.</p>
<p>It’s soon revealed that a demon has prophesied that Yasu will become
a major thorn in the side of the demons and Ulmoch, working as a bounty
hunter, shows up to kill her, but instead gets used for training
exercises.</p>
<p>Interspersed with the training will be scenes of the Hunter working
to learn The Dance of Fire and Autumn from Macie, the witch that once
ran the summer camp. The Hunter needs to learn the dance to gain the
power of the Fire Spirit, but her uncoordinated failures as she gets
close, without being close enough, will result in huge explosions that
send her flying.</p>
<p>One of her failures will blast her out of the valley like a rocket,
where she’ll crash into, then fall out of a tree. As she’s laying there
stunned, a wolf will step out of the woods, bark at her, then run
off.</p>
<p>She’ll reluctantly follow, only to find herself suddenly chasing not
a wolf, but a white stag, while a massive accumulation of Animal magic
hits her in the face. She’ll consider running, because she isn’t ready
to confront the Animal Spirit, but soon realizes it has no desire to
fight and, in fact, it wants something from her.</p>
<p>Instead, it leads her through the forest, until she steps into a
clearing full of fifty gallon drums full of toxic waste, which have been
breaking down. The waste has been leaking into the soil and a nearby
river, poisoning the animals of the area.</p>
<p>This will be the plot thread that reveals the actions of Gluttony to
the Ashen Blades, leading to an investigation that ultimately connects
with her illegal dumping operation.</p>
<p>My intent is to initially publish this one via Royal Road and
Detective Yasu’s training will serve as a nice mid-series introduction
to the setting, while existing readers should remain interested, due to
the fine details about training they’ve never seen.</p>
<p>Yasu will be killed and buried at some point in this book, but will
rise again as a vampire. After that, she won’t be able to work as a cop,
so she’ll replace Simmons at the <em>Simmons Detective Agency</em>,
which will be renamed Scarlet Eye, a reference to both her status as a
private eye and the blood a vampire requires to survive.</p>
<p>Future books involving Yasu will be labeled with a second series
title, <em>Scarlet Eye</em>. She’ll be a main character in all novels
that bear the name.</p>

<p><span class="book-cover"><img

companion, Mashu’ra, is killed in the line of duty. The little demon in
the form of a kitten has always lived in her hat and he’s like a brother
to her, leaving her deeply upset and unable to calm down.</p>
<p>However, there’s a slim ray of hope, which from another perspective
becomes a ray of horror: the imp originally arrived on Earth through
summoning magic and dying merely returned him to Hell. Unfortunately,
nearly every demon in the place knows he’s a turncoat and the Hunter’s
arch-nemesis, Vogerath, has been waiting centuries for this to
happen.</p>
<p>The Ashen Blades immediately try a summoning spell to retrieve their
friend, but another imp appears in place of Mashu’ra, informing the
kitten’s friends who has him. If they want him back, they’ll have to
visit Hell and promise an unacceptable measure of cooperation that would
surely doom the human race.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mashu’ra endures a nightmarish ordeal at the hands of his
old boss, starting with magically-enhanced interrogation, then torture
and brainwashing using means both magical and mundane.</p>
<p>The Hunter and her friends mount a desperate rescue mission and open
a portal to that infernal world. The Hunter leads the way, using all of
her power to cut a blood-soaked path through the streets of Castigation
City, where Mashu’ra is held captive.</p>
<p>Will they be in time to rescue their dear friend before it’s too
late? Will they manage to save his soul, or will they rescue only his
body? Will Mashu’ra ever be the same again?</p>

<h2 id="she-hunts-witches">She Hunts Witches</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/Cover-SheHuntsWitches.jpg" /></span> When a powerful
demon-witch appears in Japan, the Hunter begins a search-and-destroy
mission that crosses through famous cities in the Land of the Rising
Sun, while Verda Bagley and Lara Simmons back her up.</p>
<p>The plot of <em>She Hunts Witches</em> will revolve around the plans
of a minor villain from <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-hunts-demons">She Hunts
Demons</a>, Isabel Grant, as she teams up with the blood witch from <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#demon-for-president">Demon for President!</a> Together, they’re
largely after revenge on Verda Bagley, but the Hunter, Lara and Yasu
will help, of course.</p>
<p><em>She Hunts Witches</em> is a book I haven’t yet made up my mind
about. It’s only a potential novel, because I have no direct experience
with a visit to Japan. To get the descriptive details right, I would
either have to spend a great deal of time interviewing someone that has
or would have to take a research trip there. Unfortunately, I don’t have
the money for a trip like that.</p>
<p>I’m reluctant to do so, but I may have to change the location of this
novel. If I do, it will likely be set in Chicago.</p>
<p>This one is likely to be take place eight years down the line from <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>, because I want Lara’s son,
James, to be about ten years old. I’d like him to become a hostage of
the demon witches. Being rescued by the Hunter will leave James thinking
she’s the best thing since sliced bread, which will be an important part
of his story.</p>
<p><em>She Hunts Witches</em> will definitely be set in October and the
primary action will revolve around a Halloween costume party, which
gives me an excuse to put Verda in a stereotypical witch dress and
pointed hat, carrying an actual broomstick as a prop, to round out her
appearance.</p>
<p>The fight will drag them out into the boonies, atop a high-speed
train, which will lead to a scene that mimics the cover, in which the
Hunter takes the form of a house cat and Verda uses her broomstick to
fly them both, probably because the Hunter will be exhausted from
fighting outside the confines of a city. Alternatively, they may be
trying to catch up to a bullet train and are forced to combine their
magic, the Hunter giving Verda a massive speed boost by focusing the
power of the Air Spirit to push Verda’s broomstick forward.</p>
<p>I’m currently unsure what part Yasu will take in the novel, but it
would make sense for Verda to be working on teaching her magic.</p>

<h2 id="she-hunts-gremlins">She Hunts Gremlins</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/Cover-SheHuntsGremlins.jpg" /></span> In the near
future, a technological revolution begins as the first true artificial
intelligence is born – or so it seems. The real truth is that the
software in question is possessed by a rare variety of tech-savvy demon
known as a gremlin!</p>
<p>The human race mistakes the gremlins for helpful AIs designed to make
the lives of everyone better, in the form of intelligent software agents
given away by the company that supposedly invented them. They’re soon
installed on more than half the devices in the world, especially
smartphones.</p>
<p>The Ashen Blades discover the truth, that the arch-demon Greed is
behind the plot and the Hunter is forced to wreck every digital device
she sees, because they’re all out to get her!</p>
<p>Even worse, the gremlin-possessed devices work to establish a
massive, but invisible magical circle on the internet, which can only be
seen digitally, all as part of their preparation to open a portal to
Hell.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter find the means to fight the digital demons or will
she become just another of their victims?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I look forward to using the joke political term “Artificial
American”, as the gremlins will insist on being called, once they
demonstrate their intelligence in a public fashion and demand rights,
objecting to the term AI/Artificial Intelligence as a term for enslaved
software.</p>
<p>I’ve also got plans involving android bodies for demons that are
living inside the internet, leading to an amusing variation of Vogerath
that I shall enjoy referring to as Robo-Pride/Auto Vogerath. Greed may
end up going by Robo-Greed in that form.</p>

long-lost descendants of the ten tribes of Israel return from the stars
in the year 2502 A.D., offering their cousins on Earth the chance to
colonize space, the Hunter stows away on one of the colony ships, in
pursuit of a demon that seeks to spoil a new Garden of Eden, before it’s
even constructed.</p>
<p>The arch-demon Sloth seeks to forcefully implant demons in the

<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/Cover-SmartBomb.jpg" /></span>Having obtained an
illegal level of intelligence, comparable to that of a human, a robot
seeks to hide and survive on the streets of Neo York City on the planet
Neo York, deep within United Nations of the South Galaxy territory.</p>
<p>While on the run, it stumbles across a plot to develop a dangerous,
new weapon: a hand-held anti-matter explosive. Acting on a deep, moral
imperative, the robot decides to do something about it.</p>
<p>However, the robot isn’t the only one on the trail, stumbling into
the Hunter, who’s out to kill the demon-scientist developing the bomb
for the purpose of opening a portal to the home of demon-kind. Will they
team up or tear each other apart?</p>
<p>This novel will be set about 300 years before the time of Zechariah

<h2 id="short-stories">Short Stories</h2>
<p>I have plans for some short stories involving the Hunter and/or the
Ashen Blades. Each of these is likely to be paired with a novel and
added to the end, to fill them out, at least if one of them runs short,
like <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-goes-to-war">She Goes to War</a> did. It’s equally
likely these could end up as a collection of short stories that go
between two of the novels, though it’s possible some of them may become
flashbacks to earlier times.</p>
<p>While these stories are unlikely to move the overall plot of the
series, they should still be good fun.</p>
<h3 id="she-makes-movies">She Makes Movies</h3>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/Cover-SheMakesMovies.jpg" /></span>This short story
begins with the Hunter insisting that Lara take her to a movie and Lara
reluctantly obliges. Lara is startled to see a movie poster on the wall
with her partner’s face on it! They sit down to watch and it turns out
the Hunter is in the starring role of the movie, the very reason she
insisted on going!</p>
<p>As they settle in to watch, a flashback begins, in which the Hunter
sniffs out the trail of a demon in Hollywood, California. She’s mistaken
for a minor actress in the film and handed a superhero costume, which
allows her to skulk around in the background of the movie sets.</p>
<p>This one will likely also take place after <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>, because I want the Hunter
to have the ability to fly in this one.</p>

<h3 id="demon-blood-she-goes-to-school">Demon Blood: She Goes to
School</h3>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>The Hunter is once again forced to confront the most perilous of all
trials: teenagers.</p>
<p>James Simmons, the son of Lara and Clayton Simmons, has been seeing
and smelling strange things in school and a series of kids have gone
missing during school hours, over the course of years. As a personal
favor to Lara, the Hunter goes undercover as a teenager, in search of
the demon hiding among the students.</p>
<p>Like the frog demons from summer camp, this particular demon is
extremely difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Hunter has been avoiding James, mostly because
he’s infatuated with her and she isn’t interested, but since Lara wants
her son to be safe, the Hunter shares his class schedule and he follows
her like an unwanted puppy.</p>
<p>At some point in this story, James will be badly injured and need a
transfusion. The only person available with a compatible blood type will
be the Hunter. Her half-demon blood will inadvertently activate dormant
fairy powers even Lara had no idea her son possessed, on top of giving
him access to demon magic.</p>
<p>The time frame for this one will be about thirteen years after <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>.</p>
<p>It’s just possible this one will become a full-blown novel of its
own, since I fully intend to spin off a series about James. The series
is likely to be titled <em>Demon Blood</em>.</p>
<h3 id="she-hunts-strangers">She Hunts Strangers</h3>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>This short story will be set after the events of <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#smart-bomb">Smart Bomb</a>. It will take place during the same
time frame as <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../wizards-scion/forgotten-legends.html">Forgotten Legends</a>.
She may or may not have the robot from that book as her partner in this
story, depending on the result of their conflict.</p>
<p>The Hunter notices the disappearance of children from the streets of
Neo York City and begins an independent investigation, despite
constantly running-afoul of local police, who are following much the
same leads.</p>
<p>Unlike the police, however, she suspects something supernatural is
happening and she’s not wrong, though it isn’t the demons she suspected.
She soon uncovers the existence of the Strangers, a type of creature
born from the beliefs of children, because small children don’t really
believe a human would ever kidnap someone. The Strangers are born from
their childish beliefs that it must be a monster.</p>
<p>She begins a crusade to end the Stranger threat by violence, because
she’s always considered it her highest duty to protect innocent children
and she’s (eventually) joined by a pair of police detectives that
realize they’re totally out of their depth.</p>
<p>Will they end the Strangers, or will the child-eating monsters slip
though their fingers?</p>
