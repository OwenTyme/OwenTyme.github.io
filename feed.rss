The Steel Wizard, Captain Levi Jacobs, is woken in the night by his
pregnant wife, with happy news their child is coming, but joy becomes
tragedy as she dies in childbirth. Reeling from this loss, he vows to
raise their daughter to be a strong hero, just like her mother, but even
that fleeting comfort is stolen from the bittersweet moment as the poor
infant struggles to breathe and dies in his arms!</p>
<p>Reeling at the loss, he staggers from one defeat to the next, slowly
losing everything else he cares about.</p>
<p>Finally, after a particularly traumatic defeat at the hands of a new
enemy, followed by a prolonged kidnapping involving the forced
administration of narcotics to make him complaint, he lies in the
infirmary of his ship, grief-stricken and struggling with addiction
withdrawal. Just when he’s at an all-time low, he’s offered a ray of
unusual hope, reminded that he once witnessed his future self travel
through time.</p>
<p>Armed with this memory, he focuses to unlock the secrets of temporal
magic, intent on undoing months of terrible events, only to find it’s
not so easy, because he has to fight to gain the approval of the Moirai,
better known as the Three Fates and speaking with them is no easy
task.</p>
<p>Can Levi change history or will all that he loves remain forever lost
in the past?</p>

Steel Wizard, Captain Levi Jacobs, second-guesses himself over a shuttle
and her crew that dangerously vanish into deep space. As search and
rescue operations fail to turn up any any trace of them and he’s
pressured to declare them ‘missing, presumed dead’, his worries
grow.</p>
<p>After following a nearly-hopeless trail of bread crumbs, he discovers
the shuttle crew managed to return to their home planet, but were killed
shortly after arriving by a skilled necromancer-witch named Cha’da and
her crew of goblin pirates. With his hopes of rescuing his people
dashed, Levi turns his attention to punishing the responsible party.</p>
<p>In the background, strange mysteries unfold as the invisible moon no
one knew the world had reveals itself as a crescent that grows toward a
full circle in the sky!</p>
<p>As the sun sets and the full moon rises, Levi faces Cha’da in a
magical duel, but nothing is as it appears. Cha’da isn’t evil, having
killed the shuttle crew in self-defense, while subtly trying to redirect
her blood-thirsty pirate crew to a less violent way of life.</p>
<p>As night begins and strange ‘Harbingers of Doom’ from the moon crash
into the ocean, bent on harvesting life energy, the two enemies are
forced to fight back-to-back, just to survive!</p>
<p>Will Levi and Cha’da live long enough to save the world or will the
alien harvesters steal the souls of everyone they love as part of their
dark harvest?</p>

Plagued by horrific nightmares, the consequences of war and reeling from
the loss of his family, the Steel Wizard, Levi Jacobs copes by throwing
himself into work, but old enemies gain the power to travel through
time, refusing to give him a moment to grieve. Making matters worse, an
impatient and violent alien pirate lurks in orbit.</p>
<p>Far from friendly, the alien pirate is boiling with rage over several
massive blows to his pride at the hands of humanoids. Unable to kill
those responsible, instead he plots revenge on their child, Levi, and
everyone around him, to regain face in the eyes of his own kind, for
whom personal pride is literally everything, including social ranking
and the right to rule.</p>
<p>While Levi’s busy dealing with the pirate, a deposed prince scours
history for allies, putting together a frightening misfit team of spies,
dangerous trolls and wizards that all have a grudge to settle with Levi
and his family. Intent on changing history to suit themselves, they
strike at the foundations of the present, threatening to kill Levi’s
father at a pivotal moment on which the history of the galaxy hangs.</p>
<p>Will Levi solve this mess and move forward with his life or will he
buckle under the responsibility of protecting both what he has and what
he’s lost?</p>

<p>Levi hated the monster from under the bed as a child, but when he
meets the creature as a young adult, he quickly learns nothing will be
the same in his life, ever again. The creature of darkness pleads for
his aid in a coming war and the young wizard reluctantly agrees, making
it his familiar.</p>
<p>Levi’s family and friends are soon caught up in a galaxy-wide war to
decide the fate of humanity and continually come face to face with
monsters straight out of myth and legend, including the dreaded Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse! The old gods and monsters humanity revered
before the rise of science and reason are angry over being ignored and
seek to force humanity to believe in them once more!</p>
<p>The young wizard’s allies find themselves in a unique position to
fight the supernatural creatures, since they’re gifted with magical
powers of their own, soon sparking a wave of resistance from the
governments of the galaxy, as they take the fight to the legends!</p>
<p>However, the battle isn’t easy, because the forgotten legends weren’t
idle over the millennia, having built an impressive manufacturing
facility that draws matter straight from a star to build warships at an
incredible rate, churning them out faster than humanity can deal with!
Worse yet, these ships have the very best in weaponry that both magic
and science can produce.</p>
<p>Will Levi and his family overcome the endless waves of disposable
warships or will the governments of the galaxy be crushed by the Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse, beginning an era of slavery under the heel
of their own forgotten legends?</p>

<p>Lyra never intended to cause the extinction of the troll race, but
when she uses the power of troll song to read the mind of a dwarf, she’s
forced to compare her life of abuse to that of a loving family.</p>
<p>Acting for the good of the world, she betrays her family and her race
by revealing the secrets of the trolls. For the sake of the dwarves,
Lyra kills her oldest sister, creating an opportunity for the dwarves to
defeat a disorganized army composed of their brothers.</p>
<p>The middle sister, Lyra’s childhood nemesis and personal tormentor,
Nicole, is furious beyond all rationality over her youngest sister’s
actions, determined to make Lyra pay, no matter the cost! Death would be
too good for Lyra, so Nicole seeks to telepathically destroy her mind,
instead!</p>
<p>Luring her sister into a trap, Lyra drops an entire mountain of ice
on their heads, intent on ending Nicole at the expense of her own
life!</p>
<p>They wake from their frozen sleep thousands of years later in a world
of wonders both scientific and magical. As Nicole escapes, the contest
begins anew and she gains control of a powerful star ship, intending to
use it as a platform for her vengeance!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lyra gains modern allies, including the influential family
and friends of a young wizard, Levi Jacobs.</p>
<p>Will Lyra defeat her murderous sister or will Nicole destroy Lyra’s
mind to fulfill her vow of vengeance? Will Lyra end the troll threat or
will Nicole become a scourge on the entire world, raiding and pillaging

Peace and quiet to think and grieve, that’s all the Hunter wanted, but
between old enemies with agendas of their own, angry elemental spirits
and her own friends never quite knowing when to leave her be, that
elusive moment of quiet contemplation is always just out of reach.</p>
<p>The Hunter’s journey began with the loss of her best friend, the only
man that was ever a father figure to her, which reminds her of losing
the first real friend she ever had, because the two private detectives
had much in common and the similarities compound her grief.</p>
<p>She walks the surface of the Moon, for what better place could there
be to seek a quiet moment? Unfortunately, she soon faces an unexpected
demon that’s been trapped there for thousands of years. Next, she tries
a remote valley watched over by an ally, but the lonely woman pesters
the Hunter until she loses her temper and is forced to leave.</p>
<p>She wanders many remote and unusual corners of the world, always in
search of that moment of solitude, that she might reflect on the past,
but the arch-demon known as Wrath has taken a liking to her, and seeks
her hand in marriage. To that end, he posts a bounty for her capture and
the path to emotional healing becomes a frustrating battlefield.</p>
<p>She seeks the mythic last of all sanctuaries, but instead finds a
half-demon girl much like herself, and a quest to help the lonely child
connect with family.</p>
<p>In the midst of the Hunter’s busy and frenetic life, will she find a
moment to grieve her two best friends and learn to move on, or will all
of creation forever stand in the way?</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="ashen-blades">Ashen Blades</h1>
<p>This series centers around the life of a half-demon girl that calls
herself the Hunter, whose parents were murdered by demons. Joining her
crusade against demon-kind are the Ashen Blades, also known as the Order
of Ash and Smoke, an organization of demon hunters.</p>
<p>The Hunter starts out with demon powers only, but eventually learns
that she’s also a witch, because her mother was a witch before she
became a demon. In <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-goes-to-war">She Goes to War</a>, she
gains an unwanted connection to an elemental spirit that draws in others
like it, starting a secondary war she doesn’t want, just so she can
retain her sanity (such as it is) and humanity.</p>
<p>She’s effectively mute, cursed by her nemesis to only be able to say,
“It’s a secret.” Therefore, she expresses herself in very physical ways
and has a fondness for offensive gestures.</p>
<p>She’s also beyond tenacious and absolutely never gives up, to the
point of bordering on or fully crossing into the realm of insanity. In
truth, the psychological makeup of a half-demon isn’t particularly
stable and later works reveal that she effectively has two
personalities, one representing her witch side, while the other
represents her demonic heritage. Fortunately for the world, her human
side is normally the one in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>The series starts out in 1940’s New York City, but decades pass
between each story, because the Hunter has the unlimited lifespan of a
demon and the series doesn’t stay in New York, though the Hunter is a
New Yorker to her core.</p>

plan to open a gate between worlds, so the vast armies of Hell might
march forth and conquer the Earth. This becomes easier once nuclear
weapons become available, in 1945, which have power enough to punch
brief holes in reality.</p>
<p>However, Pride needs more than just a massive quantity of energy:
only a half-demon can stabilize the connection for safe passage. The
only option available is a girl that calls herself the Hunter and
absolutely hates demons, because Pride made the mistake of murdering her
parents when she was three years old. She’s supported by the Ashen
Blades, an organization of human demon hunters that serve as Earth’s
last line of defense in the invisible war between humanity and the
ceaseless tide of evil.</p>
<p>Pride begins with subtle manipulation and tests of the Hunter’s
capabilities, then progresses to taking hostages, in an attempt to force
her cooperation, but he never counted on how stubborn the girl can be,
because she’d sooner die, since the whole of humanity is on the
line.</p>
<p>In 1945, their conflict takes them from New York City to White Sands,
New Mexico and the range the first atomic bomb was tested on. In 1972,
they fight another battle in the jungles of Vietnam as Pride works to
open a portal in the war zone. In 1986, a summer camp for teens becomes
the backdrop as some of the arch-demon’s minions make a third attempt at
opening a portal. In 2024, Pride runs for President of the United
States, in an attempt to gain both access to nuclear weapons and
sufficient resources to arrange everything, to the last detail,
including capture of the Hunter.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter and her friends stop Pride once and for all, or will
he succeed in opening a portal, allowing him to feed humanity to his
mysterious master?</p>

Ashen Blades is <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/she-goes-to-war.html">She Goes to War</a>, in
which the Hunter feels drawn to Vietnam, in 1972, certain her nemesis
has returned to Earth.</p>
<p>What follows is a wild ride through a war zone as she tracks Vogerath
down, magically tugged in a particular direction, but just as everyone
else that fought in the war experienced, nothing goes according to plan
and the moment she touches down in the jungle, her animal instincts take
over, because the Spirit of the Jungle itself takes offense at her mere
presence.</p>
<p>Her own team, led by her partner, Clayton Simmons, are forced to
track her down and knock some sense into her.</p>
<p>The Hunter doesn’t know it, but Vogerath summoned her to Vietnam with
the intent of using her to weaken his master, all so he can be free of
the demonic pact of slavery he’s been stuck with since the previous
book.</p>

<p><span class="book-cover"><img

once a symbol of wealth and status, but the arch-demon, Gluttony, has
slimmed down to embrace the modern world and what finer way to corrupt
the rich than with over-spending, wasteful consumption, illegal waste
dumping and willful ignorance of the way their actions affect the rest
of the world?</p>
<p>And what better tool could a demon in a corporate shark’s skin use
than massive mega-corporations that have no conscience and would sell
their soul to make a buck? Business is bigger than ever and Gluttony is
right at the center of it all, with a plan for every occasion and an
entire network of shell companies to shuffle the blame around, until it
can be dropped on someone innocent.</p>
<p>However, there’s one little hitch in her plans to corrupt the
business world: the Ashen Blades have just been tipped off about what
she’s doing and the Hunter is coming for her.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter stop Gluttony from consuming the business world from
the inside or will Gluttony succeed in corrupting and dirtying the hands
of the largest corporations in the world?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This novel will bring a New York detective into the Hunter’s team
(Shime Yasu, but she’ll become a main character in this one) and that
will provide an opportunity to show how the Ashen Blades train new
recruits.</p>
<p>This novel will begin with Detective Shime Yasu, a New York City cop,
grows bored with the mundane, everyday drudgery of life and decides to
take the Ashen Blades up on their offer of membership and training.
Readers may recall she was a very minor character in <em>Demon for
President!</em></p>
<p>This opening will show much greater detail on the way the Ashen
Blades perform training and introduce elements of their work that have
never been detailed before. Yasu will be trained in The Cauldron of the
Elements, which was introduced in <em>She Goes to Summer Camp</em>.</p>
<p>It’s soon revealed that a demon has prophesied that Yau will become a
major thorn in the side of the demons and Ulmoch, working as a bounty
hunter, shows up to kill her, but instead gets used for training
exercises.</p>
<p>Interspersed with the training will be scenes of the Hunter working
to learn The Dance of Fire and Autumn from Macie, the witch that once
ran the summer camp. The Hunter needs to learn the dance to gain the
power of the Fire Spirit, but her uncoordinated failures as she gets
close, without being close enough, will result in huge explosions that
send her flying.</p>
<p>One of her failures will blast her out of the valley like a rocket,
where she’ll crash into, then fall out of a tree. As she’s laying there
stunned, a wolf will step out of the woods, bark at her, then run
off.</p>
<p>She’ll reluctantly follow, only to find herself suddenly chasing not
a wolf, but a white stag, while a massive accumulation of Animal magic
hits her in the face. She’ll consider running, because she isn’t ready
to confront the Animal Spirit, but soon realizes it has no desire to
fight and, in fact, it wants something from her.</p>
<p>Instead, it leads her through the forest, until she steps into a
clearing full of fifty gallon drums full of toxic waste, which have been
breaking down. The waste has been leaking into the soil and a nearby
river, poisoning the animals of the area.</p>
<p>This will be the plot thread that reveals the actions of Gluttony to
the Ashen Blades, leading to an investigation that ultimately connects
with her illegal dumping operation.</p>
<p>My intent is to initially publish this one via Royal Road and
Detective Yasu’s training will serve as a nice mid-series introduction
to the setting, while existing readers should remain interested, due to
the fine details about training they’ve never seen.</p>

<h2 id="homecoming">Homecoming</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img

companion, Mashu’ra, is killed in the line of duty. The little demon in
the form of a kitten has always lived in her hat and he’s like a brother
to her, leaving her deeply upset and unable to calm down.</p>
<p>However, there’s a slim ray of hope, which from another perspective
becomes a ray of horror: the imp originally arrived on Earth through
summoning magic and dying merely returned him to Hell. Unfortunately,
nearly every demon in the place knows he’s a turncoat and the Hunter’s
arch-nemesis, Vogerath, has been waiting centuries for this to
happen.</p>
<p>The Ashen Blades immediately try a summoning spell to retrieve their
friend, but another imp appears in place of Mashu’ra, informing the
kitten’s friends who has him. If they want him back, they’ll have to
visit Hell and promise an unacceptable measure of cooperation that would
surely doom the human race.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mashu’ra endures a nightmarish ordeal at the hands of his
old boss, starting with magically-enhanced interrogation, then torture
and brainwashing using means both magical and mundane.</p>
<p>The Hunter and her friends mount a desperate rescue mission and open
a portal to that infernal world. The Hunter leads the way, using all of
her power to cut a blood-soaked path through the streets of Castigation
City, where Mashu’ra is held captive.</p>
<p>Will they be in time to rescue their dear friend before it’s too
late? Will they manage to save his soul, or will they rescue only his
body? Will Mashu’ra ever be the same again?</p>

<h2 id="she-hunts-witches">She Hunts Witches</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/Cover-SheHuntsWitches.jpg" /></span> When a powerful
demon-witch appears in Japan, the Hunter begins a search-and-destroy
mission that crosses through famous cities in the Land of the Rising
Sun, while Verda Bagley and Lara Simmons back her up.</p>
<p>The plot of <em>She Hunts Witches</em> will revolve around the plans
of a minor villain from <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-hunts-demons">She Hunts
Demons</a>, Isabel Grant, as she teams up with the blood witch from <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#demon-for-president">Demon for President!</a>. Together, they’re
largely after revenge on the Verda Bagley, but the Hunter, Lara and Yasu
will help, of course.</p>
<p><em>She Hunts Witches</em> is a book I haven’t yet made up my mind
about. It’s only a potential novel, because I have no direct experience
with a visit to Japan. To get the descriptive details right, I would
either have to spend a great deal of time interviewing someone that has
or would have to take a research trip there. Unfortunately, I don’t have
the money for a trip like that.</p>
<p>I’m reluctant to do so, but I may have to change the location of this
novel. If I do, it will be set in New York City.</p>
<p>This one is likely to be take place eight years down the line from <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>, because I want Lara’s son,
James, to be about ten years old. I’d like him to become a hostage of
the demon witches. Being rescued by the Hunter will leave James thinking
she’s the best thing since sliced bread, which will be an important part
of his story.</p>
<p><em>She Hunts Witches</em> will definitely be set in October and the
primary action will revolve around a Halloween costume party, which
gives me an excuse to put Verda in a stereotypical witch dress and
pointed hat, carrying an actual broomstick as a prop, to round out her
appearance.</p>
<p>The fight will drag them out into the boonies, atop a high-speed
train, which will lead to a scene that mimics the cover, in which the
Hunter takes the form of a house cat and Verda uses her broomstick to
fly them both, probably because the Hunter will be exhausted from
fighting outside the confines of a city. Alternatively, they may be
trying to catch up to a bullet train and are forced to combine their
magic, the Hunter giving Verda a massive speed boost by focusing the
power of the Air Spirit to push Verda’s broomstick forward.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/Cover-SheHuntsGremlins.jpg" /></span> In the near
future, a technological revolution begins as the first true artificial
intelligence is born – or so it seems. The real truth is that the
software in question is possessed by a rare variety of tech-savvy demon
known as a gremlin!</p>
<p>The human race mistakes the gremlins for helpful AIs designed to make
the lives of everyone better, in the form of intelligent software agents
given away by the company that supposedly invented them. They’re soon
installed on more than half the devices in the world, especially
smartphones.</p>
<p>The Ashen Blades soon discover the truth, that the arch-demon Greed
is behind the plot and the Hunter is forced to wreck every digital
device she sees, because they’re all out to get her!</p>
<p>Even worse, the gremlin-possessed devices work to establish a
massive, but invisible magical circle on the internet, which can only be
seen digitally, all as part of their preparation to open a portal to
Hell.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter find the means to fight the digital demons or will
she become just another of their victims?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I look forward to using the joke political term “Artificial
American”, as the gremlins will insist on being called, once they
demonstrate their intelligence in a public fashion and demand rights,
objecting to the term AI/Artificial Intelligence as a term for enslaved
software.</p>
<p>I’ve also got plans involving android bodies for demons that are
living inside the internet, leading to an amusing variation of Vogerath
that I shall enjoy referring to as Robo-Pride. Greed may end up going by
Robo-Greed in that form.</p>

<h2 id="short-stories">Short Stories</h2>
<p>I have plans for some short stories involving the Hunter and/or the

added to the end, to fill them out, at least if one of them runs short,
like <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-goes-to-war">She Goes to War</a> did. It’s equally
likely these could end up as a collection of short stories that go
between two of the novels, though it’s possible some of them may become
flashbacks to earlier times.</p>
<p>While these stories are unlikely to move the overall plot of the
series, they should still be good fun.</p>
<h3 id="she-makes-movies">She Makes Movies</h3>

<p><span class="book-cover"><img

begins with the Hunter insisting that Lara take her to a movie and Lara
reluctantly obliges. Lara is startled to see a movie poster on the wall
with her partner’s face on it! They sit down to watch and it turns out
the Hunter is in the starring role of the movie, the very reason she
insisted on going!</p>
<p>As they settle in to watch, a flashback begins, in which the Hunter
sniffs out the trail of a demon in Hollywood, California. She’s mistaken
for a minor actress in the film and handed a superhero costume, which
allows her to skulk around in the background of the movie sets.</p>
<p>This one will likely also take place after <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>, because I want the Hunter
to have the ability to fly in this one.</p>

School</h3>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>The Hunter is once again forced to confront the most perilous of all
trials: teenagers.</p>
<p>James Simmons, the son of Lara and Clayton Simmons, has been seeing
and smelling strange things in school and a series of kids have gone
missing during school hours, over the course of years. As a personal
favor to Lara, the Hunter goes undercover as a teenager, in search of
the demon hiding among the students.</p>
<p>Like the frog demons from summer camp, this particular demon is
extremely difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Hunter has been avoiding James, mostly because
he’s infatuated with her and she isn’t interested, but since Lara wants
her son to be safe, the Hunter shares his class schedule and he follows
her like an unwanted puppy.</p>
<p>At some point in this story, James will be badly injured and need a
transfusion. The only person available with a compatible blood type will
be the Hunter. Her half-demon blood will inadvertently activate dormant
fairy powers even Lara had no idea her son possessed, on top of giving
him access to demon magic.</p>
<p>The time frame for this one will be about thirteen years after <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>.</p>
<p>It’s just possible this one will become a full-blown novel of its
own, since I fully intend to spin off a series about James. The series
is likely to be titled <em>Demon Blood</em>.</p>
<h3 id="she-hunts-strangers">She Hunts Strangers</h3>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>This short story will be set after the events of <a

time frame as <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../wizards-scion/forgotten-legends.html">Forgotten Legends</a>.
She may or may not have the robot from that book as her partner in this
story, depending on the result of their conflict.</p>
<p>The Hunter notices the disappearance of children from the streets of
Neo York City and begins an independent investigation, despite
constantly running-afoul of local police, who are following much the
same leads.</p>
<p>Unlike the police, however, she suspects something supernatural is
happening and she’s not wrong, though it isn’t the demons she suspected.
She soon uncovers the existence of the Strangers, a type of creature
born from the beliefs of children, because small children don’t really
believe a human would ever kidnap someone. The Strangers are born from
their childish beliefs that it must be a monster.</p>
<p>She begins a crusade to end the Stranger threat by violence, because
she’s always considered it her highest duty to protect innocent children
and she’s (eventually) joined by a pair of police detectives that
realize they’re totally out of their depth.</p>
<p>Will they end the Strangers, or will the child-eating monsters slip
though their fingers?</p>

Hunter never wanted to go to war, but in 1972, she senses the return of
her demonic arch-nemesis, Vogerath, to the world. Following his magic
like a bloodhound, she finds herself inexplicably drawn to Vietnam, a
war zone.</p>
<p>With a pressing need to kill Vogerath, who claims to be the serpent
from the Garden of Eden, the half-demon Hunter is joined by her
detective partner, Clayton Simmons, and a powerful witch, Verda
Bagley.</p>
<p>It was meant to be a simple search and destroy mission, but nothing
in the jungles of Vietnam is ever simple and their plans go off the
rails the moment the Hunter sets foot on the ground. She’s overcome by
the magic of the jungle, which causes her to forget her humanity and
transform into a great, black cat with blue eyes!</p>
<p>Her team are forced to subdue her, to bring her back to her senses,
but the consequences of her instinct-driven actions leave them troubled,
because she killed a demon disguised as an American soldier and his best
friend wants revenge! As this fresh, unwanted conflict comes to a close,
the Hunter’s hands are reluctantly stained with human blood.</p>
<p>Vogerath’s jungle hideout is surrounded by soldiers and the raid
begins, but the Hunter’s plan continues to go wrong. After a unit of
tanks is overrun, the US military throws everything they’ve got at the

stronger with each attack and awaits the power of a nuclear strike,
planning to use it to open a portal to Hell, so endless legions of
demons can march forth to conquer the Earth!</p>

world be conquered by demons?</p>

the last place the Hunter wanted to go, but she’d made a vow to protect
humanity from demons, no matter where they appeared and in 1986, her
team of demon-slaying experts is called on to investigate. However, to
make things even worse, the Hunter’s team leader sends her into the camp
as an undercover operative, under the guise of a regular teen, despite
the fact that the half-demon girl being old enough to be the grandmother
of the kids at camp.</p>
<p>She’s soon caught up in the daily minutiae of camp, learning a few
new things along the way, while followed around like a puppy by a new
“friend”, a motor-mouthed girl that never shuts up. On the very first
day, she also acquires a trio of teenage foes in the form of some
valley-girl sisters from Los Angeles, who take every opportunity to
insult and plays pranks on her.</p>
<p>However, despite the innocent look of the place, danger lurks around
every corner, because the owner of the camp, Miss Macie Weber, is an
untrained witch, whose unknowing, haywire magic threatens to kill
everyone by summoning powerful and vengeful nature spirits, on top of
the demons already lurking among the humans at camp!</p>
<p>Will the Hunter find and slay the the demons or will the nature
spirits take offense at her mere presence, because she’s had the Jungle
Spirit stuck inside her head since 1972?</p>

<p>The half-demon girl who calls herself the Hunter never really
considered why she wanted all demons dead, but when she’s presented with
the one responsible for killing her parents, she loses all rationality,
going on the warpath.</p>
<p>It started with a crying widow and a stack of letters, leading the
Hunter’s private detective partner, Clayton Simmons, to investigate a
series of financial crimes. These threads all lead to the mysterious
Otto Vogerath, who’s rumored to be a mobster.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Hunter’s earliest memories begin coming into
focus, giving her clarity about the death of her parents at the hands of
the very same, because Vogerath isn’t just a mobster: he’s also a demon
that claims to be the serpent from the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>The duo and their allies are soon caught in a complex spider’s web of
mystery, involving conspiracies, murders, atom bombs and the demon’s
plot to tear a massive hole in reality, all of which revolves around the
life of the Hunter. Worse still, the demon requires the Hunter’s
cooperation for his plans to succeed and will do almost anything to get
it, repeatedly proving to her that everyone she cares for is in danger,
so long as she stands in the way of what he wants.</p>
<p>Will Simmons and the Hunter save the world or will the serpent
succeed in opening a portal to Hell, so legions of demons can march
forth to conquer the world?</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="ideas">Ideas</h1>
<p>This page is a sort of catch-all bin of ideas for novels I may write
in the future.</p>
<h2 id="demon-blood">Demon Blood</h2>
<p>This would be a spin-off of <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html">Ashen
Blades</a> centered around the life of James Simmons. He’s a fairy, like
his mother, Lara, but he appears totally normal until probably the age
of fifteen or sixteen, at which point he’s badly injured and needs an
emergency transfusion.</p>
<p>The only person available at the time with a compatible blood type is
the Hunter/Artemis Watson, a half-demon. She donates her blood and it
activates all of the young man’s dormant powers.</p>
<p>He also turns out to be rather good at demon extermination, able to
force demons to transform, with a touch. He uses this power to forcibly
turn demons into weapons, which he uses to kill others. Best of all: his
power fully drains his weapons of all magic, permanently killing
them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he becomes a half-demon, and the demons now seek to
use him in their plots to conquer the world, very similar to
Artemis.</p>
<h2 id="second-star-working-title">Second Star (Working Title)</h2>
<p>Second star is a re-telling of Peter Pan from the perspective of
Captain Hook, with Peter cast as the villain. The setting would be based
on a twisting of many fairy tales and I’m planning to go for a gritty,
realistic feeling to the story, despite the fact it will be satire. I
may go with a Noir-style of writing, with guns and tech from the 1940’s,
though there will certainly also be magic and magical creatures.</p>
<p>Hook would be a police captain with a personal grudge against Pan,
who’s the king-pin of the local drug trade, which is based on Pixie
Dust, a hallucinogen literally produced by shaking enslaved pixies.</p>
<p>True to the original story, Pan cut Hook’s hand off and fed it to an
alligator. That led to Hook being re-assigned from narcotics to vice for
a time, which will lead to Pan nicknaming him “Captain Hooker”, just to
tick him off.</p>
<p>The novel will begin with Tinkerbell turning herself in to the
police, but she refuses to tell her story to anyone other than Hook.
That gets Hook back on the case and he sees things through from there.
Tink and Pan used to be equal partners, but when Tink grew a conscience
and wanted to stop selling drugs to kids, Pan imprisoned her, then
captured more pixies, to force them to produce more Pixie Dust.</p>
<p>I have lots of ideas for incorporating elements of the original
story, as well as many other fairy tales.</p>
<p>For example, Neverland is Pan’s nightclub, a speakeasy that the cops
can’t find, because only fairies and those high on Pixie Dust can see
the way. The directions “second star to the right and straight on till
morning” confuse them, because Second Star and Morning are street names,
but they’re parallel to each other and never cross. Only in the fairy
realm do they actually share an intersection and that’s where Neverland
is. Neverland got it’s name through Pan saying, “The cops won’t never
find this land!”</p>
<p>I plan to include Pinocchio as one of Pan’s street-level pushers.
Hook uses him as a reliable source of information, because every time
the puppet lies, his nose grows. Unfortunately, Hook doesn’t know that
Pan uses the puppet to feed Hook false information.</p>
<p>Pixie Dust has a powerful side-effect on children, slowing or even
stopping the aging process. Pan, for example, is hundreds of years old,
yet he’s never fully grown out of childish habits.</p>
<p>Pan’s gang, the Lost Boys, are nearly as old as Pan. Every one of
them is a nasty piece of work, fully of the cynicism of the streets, yet
childish as can be. Those that appear to be teens, like Pan, are the
most dangerous. They’re intellectually adults, but emotionally volatile
and prone to murderous behavior. Those that appear younger are less
trouble, but due to the way they haven’t mentally developed, they’re
effectively slaves to the older members of the gang and don’t even know
it.</p>
<p>The Lost Boys are constantly looking for new recruits and they easily
find them when children disagree with their parents, usually over petty
matters, like bedtime.</p>
<p>However, they’re just as likely to sell them drugs, instead.</p>
<p>The climax of the novel will involve Pan blowing a handful of Pixie
Dust in Hook’s face, while growling, “Could you just lighten up, for
once?”</p>
<p>At that point, Hook will wander the streets, high as a kite, but
he’ll finally see how the streets bend and cross, at least in his mind.
Before he begins to come down, he gathers men from the station, in full
tactical gear, and leads them in a raid on Neverland, leading to a grand
melee with the Lost Boys, while Hook confronts Pan.</p>
<h2 id="thorn-of-the-rose-working-title">Thorn of the Rose (Working
Title)</h2>
<p>Sandra Blake loses her parents to an unexpected attack by a
mysterious assassin. Her mother’s final words, “Don’t let it end like
this” have a chilling effect on her life and Sandra transforms herself,
both body and soul, becoming an incredibly skilled and dangerous
woman.</p>
<p>After years of intense training, she enters the seedy underworld of
modern society, exchanging stolen jewels for information on the man that
killed her parents.</p>
<p>Her uncle, Daniel Malachi, seeks to bring her in from the field, to
make her part of the Imperial Intelligence Core, which her oversees.</p>
<p>Naturally, they come into conflict, but Sandra goes through Malachi’s
men like a lawn mower cuts grass. Nonetheless, when her uncle speaks to
her, her resolve weakens and she agrees to work for him as a spy.</p>
<p>Will Sandra stay on task and do as she’s told, or will she go
off-book to find the man she wants to punish?</p>
<p>This would be a rewrite of a novel I started in college (20 years
ago), which I lacked the skill to finish at the time.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite qualities of Sandra were the contradiction
between how much pain she feels and how capable she is, as well as her
tendency to defeat high tech security gadgets with simple kitchen
utensils. Add her total lack of understanding of computer software (she
had a rudimentary understanding of networking cables, however, in the
sense of knowing what they were and how to cut them) and she was quite
fun to write.</p>
<p>This more modern variation would take place in the Northwestern
Empire, likely during the time skip at the end of <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/wizards-scion/the-inverted-glass.html">The Inverted Glass</a>.
Daniel Malachi was originally seen in <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/sky-children/sky-children.html">Sky Children</a> and also appeared
in <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/wizards-scion/the-third-wish.html">The Third Wish</a>, after
which he became the new spy master for the Empress of the Northwestern
Empire.</p>
<p>While Malachi is a wizard, he doesn’t flaunt that ability and not
even Sandra will know, at least until she needs to.</p>
<p>The original version of the novel opened with Sandra pretending to be
a student at a clandestine school for spies on the first day of class,
while their teacher was absent. This turned out to be ploy to avoid
teaching, a task she never wanted, but since she’s pregnant, she’s been
removed from active duty and relegated to teaching.</p>
<p>She teaches the Unconventional Tactics class, mostly by telling them
her life story, which serves as an excellent example of doing everything
the wrong way, while getting excellent results.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how much of the old novel will be used, but there’s
plenty to build on and the experience of writing Sandra has had a lot of
influence over the writer I’ve become.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-left-to-chance">Nothing Left to Chance</h2>
<p>Death is a job passed from one mortal to another over the centuries,
a job with a great many perks, including immortality, but the catch is a
doozy: death is always scrambling collect to dark souls that need to be
controlled. Worse, if Death fails and the dark souls are left unchecked,
the world will come to an end.</p>
<p>Each Death begins normal enough, then comes to an end the usual way,
but a long-standing bargain between humanity and the grim reaper entails
an ancient ritual challenge: if a mortal can beat Death in any game,
they gain immortality. The trouble is, Death can’t be beat, unless Death
chooses to lose.</p>
<p>This has happened before and will inevitably happen again, because
mortals were never meant to live forever, and sooner or later, the
Reaper always tires of Reaping. It may take ten-thousand years or just
ten, but all good things must come to an end.</p>
<p>The downside is that this usually involves all of the collected dark
souls being released, which forces the new guy to pick up the slack,
lest the world end.</p>
<p>Dragons, monsters, creatures of legend, even dark and forgotten gods
with an ax to grind – they all have to be captured and contained.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the previous Reaper always sticks around for a while,
usually in the form of a talking skull, because someone has to teach the
new guy.</p>
<p>Each book in this series would bear only a tenuous connection to the
rest and each volume in it can stand alone, with no need to write them
in any particular order. Each would focus on a particular Reaper, though
it’s possible I may find I like any given character and give them an
extra volume or two.</p>
<p>The common elements of the series from Reaper to Reaper will consist
of each facing terrible calamities in order to save the world, requiring
some choice of vessel to contain the dark souls, which determines the
powers they manifest. However, all Reapers share the power to manipulate
and travel through time, which is essential for them to ferry the souls
of the living to the afterlife.</p>
<p>In addition, they also have to choose something or someone to serve
as their immortal companion. This is traditionally a horse, but there
are a great many options available, including motorcycles, cars, other
people, etc.</p>
<h3 id="chance-on-a-gamble">Chance on a Gamble</h3>
<p>A young man that lives by gambling dies in a motorcycle accident and
meets Death, who offers him a rare chance at immortality, through a game
of poker.</p>
<p>He wins and becomes Death, while Death crumbles to just a powerless
skull, which had been serving as the containment vessel.</p>
<p>After several women reject the opportunity, the young man chooses his
motorcycle as his companion, which becomes imbued with life, then
chooses to use his deck of cards and his dice to contain the souls. The
powers he gains are extremely strong, but subject to random chance and
tend to burn out after a while.</p>
<p>To challenge myself, I’ll come up with random effects to attach to
the cards of a deck or the roll of the dice, then I’ll randomly choose
as required to determine which power he gets at any given time. During
the climax, he’ll finally find a way to stack the deck ahead of time,
rather than shuffling.</p>
<p>The more souls he gathers, the less time it will take for individual
cards to recharge after use.</p>
<h3 id="gunslingers-chance">Gunslinger’s Chance</h3>
<p>The Reaper of the Old West era began as an outlaw gunfighter, who
challenged death to a fast-draw contest of the sort favored in
Westerns.</p>
<p>Death loses on purpose and the outlaw finally finds out about the
fine print of the arrangement, forced to defend a world he hates,
because the alternative is worse.</p>
<p>The outlaw chooses his horse as his companion and his pistol as the
vessel. Each soul he captures will give him a unique power his bullets
can manifest, based on the defeated monster.</p>
<h3 id="chance-for-a-soldier">Chance for a Soldier</h3>
<p>A soldier that died on the battlefield during World War II defeats
Death in a bare knuckle bar fight.</p>
<p>The soldier chooses his best friend as a companion and their fists
serve to contain the souls. Each soul they collect will give them
greater durability and physical strength, eventually becoming like
super-heroes.</p>
<p>Together, they fight both dark souls and Nazis, but as they begin to
sway the outcome of the war, Reapers from other eras appear, to stop
them, lest they destroy the foundations of reality, by altering what was
meant to be.</p>
<p>The Reapers brawl like no battle that came before and whole cities
are decimated by the fighting.</p>
<h3 id="shinigami-of-chance">Shinigami of Chance</h3>
<p>At one point, the reaper was a Japanese samurai, who used his sword
as the the vessel and his armor as his companion. His armor became
imbued with life and the samurai came to think of it as being possessed
by a helpful, yet very clever fox yokai.</p>
<p>This one chose to think of himself as a shinigami, rather than a
Reaper.</p>
<h3 id="a-chance-insight">A Chance Insight</h3>
<p>The Reaper of this novel is a con artist that makes her living as a
fake psychic or medium.</p>
<p>She chooses her crystal ball as both the containment vessel and her
companion. She gains the rather unreliable power to gaze into the
future, while her crystal ball starts talking and can shape shift at her
command. She often uses it in the form of blunt instruments (like a
mace), since it’s made of extremely durable and heavy quartz.</p>
<h3 id="a-magical-chance">A Magical Chance</h3>
<p>The Reaper from the 1960’s is the lovely assistant of a magician and
also his wife.</p>
<p>She chooses her husband as her companion and makes magic itself the
containment vessel, transforming it into more than a mere slight-of-hand
trick.</p>
<h3 id="the-last-chance">The Last Chance</h3>
<p>The previous Reaper chooses poorly and gives his power to a man that
wishes to watch the world crumble, after losing his wife.</p>
<p>The Earth comes closer than ever to destruction as dark and evil
energy fills the world, fracturing both time and space, bringing Reapers
from the past into the present, each of them fighting to hold off the
catastrophe, despite the fact they lack the power, since they’re only
echoes of what was.</p>
<p>The new Reaper falls for one of the female Reapers of the past and
she convinces him to care, through small acts of romance. He chooses her
as his companion and together, they fight to end the catastrophe, but
the world may be too far-gone to save.</p>
<p>In a strange twist, the Reaper chooses his bond with his new wife as
his containment vessel and the attraction between them manifests as a
force that may be just enough to seal the cracks in space/time, or
possibly not…</p>
<p>This volume would likely be the last, a chance to bring the other
main characters together for one big adventure, while elements of the
real world, the future and even alternate histories mingle together.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-wizards-scion">The Wizard’s Scion</h1>
<p>This series follows the life of a great and powerful wizard’s son,
Levi Jacobs, as he grows from a teenage boy with almost no control over
his magic to a wizard of great power and reputation, that masters the
secrets of time travel.</p>
<p>The setting of this five volume series began as a relatively hard
science background, with only one big rubber science addition: some
faster than light technology that’s used for travel and communication.
Magic was largely unknown to everyone except the space pirate, until an
electrical engineer crash-landed on an “unexplored” planet that bore a
strange virus that gave him the powers of a wizard.</p>
<p>That electrical engineer who became a wizard was Levi’s father,
Zechariah. Zechariah is both directly and indirectly responsible for the
invention of many magi-tech devices, which mix magic and technology
together, using electricity to produce powerful spells beyond what any
wizard could do alone, leading to a setting in which wizards fly through
space in star ships that have the usual rubber science sci-fi bells and
whistles, including force fields and teleporters, as well as guns that
shoot magic spells.</p>

Levi Jacobs always dreamed of being more like his father, the greatest
wizard in the world, but had no real understanding of what it would be
like if he got his wish.</p>
<p>Follow Levi’s journey from bumbling teen to a great hero, while the
young wizard learns to master magical powers that are initially
completely beyond him and barely under his control.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he’s forced to deal with a psychotic telepathic
swordswoman, an army of trolls, retrieving stolen star ships, a war with
forgotten monsters that no one believes in anymore, alien space pirates,
time travelers, a telepath that collects minds like shiny stones, a
necromancer that leads a ship of murderous goblins, rock monsters from
the invisible moon, a master of manipulating probability and a perilous
trip through the Greek Underworld, to have a conversation with The
Fates.</p>
<p>But it gets worse: Levi’s family always seems to be caught in the
middle of every disaster that comes along, leaving him with no choice
but to deal with it.</p>

<p>This omnibus edition includes all five volumes in the series (see

family are neither healthy nor particularly good and seeks to escape

freedom.</p>
<p><a href="https://owentyme.us/books/wizards-scion/troll-song.html">Troll Song</a> begins fully immersed in the
fantasy elements of the series, then slows begins introducing sci-fi
elements, before fully immersing the reader in a mixture of the two,
after a large forward skip in time, because the main characters got
frozen in ice for two-thousand years.</p>
<p>That’s when Lyra meets Levi, who frees her from the ice and becomes
her first modern friend.</p>

<p>In the depths of his deepest sorrow, he’s reminded he once saw
himself travel through time. He begins studying that most dangerous and
powerful of all magics, determined to regain everything he’s lost, but
when he does gain that power, he’s forced to confront the very fates
themselves, that he might gain permission to make the changes he
desires.</p>
<p>However, just getting an opportunity to speak with them is next to
impossible, because their cave is at the end of a perilous journey
through the Greek Underworld and the realm of Hades, who’s famed for his
dislike of living intruders.</p>
