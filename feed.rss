Hunter never wanted to go to war, but in 1972, she senses the return of
her demonic arch-nemesis, Vogerath, to the world. Following his magic
like a bloodhound, she finds herself inexplicably drawn to Vietnam, a
war zone.</p>
<p>With a pressing need to kill Vogerath, who claims to be the serpent
from the Garden of Eden, the half-demon Hunter is joined by her
detective partner, Clayton Simmons, and a powerful witch, Verda
Bagley.</p>
<p>It was meant to be a simple search and destroy mission, but nothing
in the jungles of Vietnam is ever simple and their plans go off the
rails the moment the Hunter sets foot on the ground. She’s overcome by
the magic of the jungle, which causes her to forget her humanity and
transform into a great, black cat with blue eyes!</p>
<p>Her team are forced to subdue her, to bring her back to her senses,
but the consequences of her instinct-driven actions leave them troubled,
because she killed a demon disguised as an American soldier and his best
friend wants revenge! As this fresh, unwanted conflict comes to a close,
the Hunter’s hands are reluctantly stained with human blood.</p>
<p>Vogerath’s jungle hideout is surrounded by soldiers and the raid
begins, but the Hunter’s plan continues to go wrong. After a unit of
tanks is overrun, the US military throws everything they’ve got at the
demons, inadvertently playing into Vogerath’s hands! The demon grows
stronger with each attack and awaits the power of a nuclear strike,
planning to use it to open a portal to Hell, so endless legions of
demons can march forth to conquer the Earth!</p>
<p>Will the Hunter and her friends stop Vogerath in time or will the
world be conquered by demons?</p>

<p><em>She Goes to War</em> includes a bonus novella: <em>She Goes to
Summer Camp</em>, in which the Hunter faces the most unthinkable and
horrifying of challenges: teenagers. This novella is also available
separately as a free Ebook or in print.</p>

the last place the Hunter wanted to go, but she’d made a vow to protect
humanity from demons, no matter where they appeared and in 1986, her
team of demon-slaying experts is called on to investigate. However, to
make things even worse, the Hunter’s team leader sends her into the camp
as an undercover operative, under the guise of a regular teen, despite
the fact that the half-demon girl being old enough to be the grandmother
of the kids at camp.</p>
<p>She’s soon caught up in the daily minutiae of camp, learning a few
new things along the way, while followed around like a puppy by a new
“friend”, a motor-mouthed girl that never shuts up. On the very first
day, she also acquires a trio of teenage foes in the form of some
valley-girl sisters from Los Angeles, who take every opportunity to
insult and plays pranks on her.</p>
<p>However, despite the innocent look of the place, danger lurks around
every corner, because the owner of the camp, Miss Macie Weber, is an
untrained witch, whose unknowing, haywire magic threatens to kill
everyone by summoning powerful and vengeful nature spirits, on top of
the demons already lurking among the humans at camp!</p>
<p>Will the Hunter find and slay the the demons or will the nature
spirits take offense at her mere presence, because she’s had the Jungle
Spirit stuck inside her head since 1972?</p>

<p>The half-demon girl who calls herself the Hunter never really
considered why she wanted all demons dead, but when she’s presented with
the one responsible for killing her parents, she loses all rationality,
going on the warpath.</p>
<p>It started with a crying widow and a stack of letters, leading the
Hunter’s private detective partner, Clayton Simmons, to investigate a
series of financial crimes. These threads all lead to the mysterious
Otto Vogerath, who’s rumored to be a mobster.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Hunter’s earliest memories begin coming into
focus, giving her clarity about the death of her parents at the hands of
the very same, because Vogerath isn’t just a mobster: he’s also a demon
that claims to be the serpent from the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>The duo and their allies are soon caught in a complex spider’s web of
mystery, involving conspiracies, murders, atom bombs and the demon’s
plot to tear a massive hole in reality, all of which revolves around the
life of the Hunter. Worse still, the demon requires the Hunter’s
cooperation for his plans to succeed and will do almost anything to get
it, repeatedly proving to her that everyone she cares for is in danger,
so long as she stands in the way of what he wants.</p>
<p>Will Simmons and the Hunter save the world or will the serpent
succeed in opening a portal to Hell, so legions of demons can march
forth to conquer the world?</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="starwitch">Starwitch</h1>
<p>Starwitch is volume one of <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/index.html">The Book of
Newts</a>, which follows the adventures and trials of a witch that owns
a magical book detailing many secrets of science, engineering, magic and
most particularly, space travel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><a
href="https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/102509/the-book-of-newts"><img

<a href="https://www.wattpad.com/story/386378071-starwitch">Read on
Wattpad</a></span> Home, safety, and a place to belong – they seem so
easy to find, at least for everyone but Amelia Blackwell and her
sisters, who run from accusations of witchcraft at every turn.</p>
<p>It started so simply, with a book. No one might have predicted that a
book apparently filled with pictures of newts might lead to so much
trouble, but <em>The Book of Newts</em> is no ordinary volume on
taxonomic detail of amphibians. The magic book reveals its true nature
only to Amelia, at the age of ten, teaching her mathematics, science and
engineering – subjects she would not otherwise have been exposed to.</p>
<p>Ironically, she and her sisters are accused of witchcraft for having
built a horseless carriage, because to the ignorant villagers, there’s
no difference between magic and science. They settle in a new land, only
to find the same breed of persecution.</p>
<p>In an unusual ray of hope, they’re told of a distant kingdom that
openly accepts witches, but shortly after they settle there, the light
at the end of the tunnel turns out to be an awful house fire surrounding
their gilded cage: they’re drafted into the local military, because
their new nation uses witches as living weapons.</p>
<p>The sisters accept the idea that peace will never be found on the
ground. Looking to the stars, Amelia builds a space vessel powered by
magic and steam, to carry them to a brighter future, hopefully without
the strife that’s always followed them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the people of the stars have their own worries: an
ancient, undead pirate queen, who consumes the souls of powerful witches
to extend her own life. The Dead Queen takes Amelia’s sisters and leaves
the magically-weak engineer to die, all as a sick form of sport.</p>
<p>Will Amelia survive long enough to overcome this greatest of all
threats and rescue her sisters, or will they become fuel to feed the
waning magic of a woman that should have been dead centuries before?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Starwitch</em> centers on the life of Amelia Blackwell, the
youngest of a trio of sisters and witches, who start out living on a
moon and eventually use magic to launch themselves into space, to escape
persecution for their witchcraft and various troublesome political
events.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they eventually encounter the Dead Queen, an ancient
undead pirate witch that consumes the magic and lives of other witches,
to extend her own existence.</p>
<p>The series begins with Amelia aboard her magic light sail ship,
<em>Starwitch</em>, just a few days after it was badly damaged and her
sisters were kidnapped by the Dead Queen, left with only enough
resources to follow the far larger ship.</p>
<p>That’s an intentional and cruel choice by the Dead Queen, because
Amelia’s magic is deemed too weak to consume. She instead left Amelia
for dead in the hopes of some sport, something the Dead Queen has done
to countless weak witches.</p>
<p>Amelia has just enough resources to attack, but not enough to limp to
safety, so unless she gets back either the mythril spell-core of her
ship or at least one of her sisters, she’s a dead woman.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-book-of-newts">The Book of Newts</h1>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/../../images/Cover-TheBookOfNewts.jpg" /></span> <em>The Book of
Newts</em> is a remarkable volume. Paradoxically, while The Book is
exceptionally magical, the information contained within is largely not.
It details every wonder of engineering, science and astronomy that’s
been discovered by its past owners, but this information is only visible
to its owner. To all others, it appears to be a thick volume describing
every variation of newt that has ever existed, in meticulous detail,
complete with hand-drawn illustrations.</p>
<p>The Book yearns for new knowledge. To that end, it inspires those
that own it to ever greater heights, taking them to the stars and
beyond, to reach their greatest potential, but nothing in life comes
without a price and its owners rarely foresee the balance coming
due.</p>
<p>While The Book is sometimes willing to wait, it’s never satisfied and
will always drive its owner to the next horizon, to the next discovery,
that it might grow a little thicker under the weight of new
knowledge.</p>
<p>Throughout history, The Book has been the driving factor behind many
things, particularly the colonization of the stars and terraforming of
many worlds, all to serve its insatiable hunger for more.</p>
<p>Witches and wizards are drawn to the magic of The Book, but woe
betide any that choose to stand in the way of the inevitable march of
progress, because The Book has a will of its own and a terrible power to
subtly bend its owner’s mind, leaving them just as hungry for more
knowledge.</p>
<p>At first, The Book seems like a blessing, but it might also be termed
a curse. That’s because it always seems to draw unwanted attention, but
never to itself, and its owners become magnets for trouble of all sorts.
Accusations of witchcraft often follow them, because science beyond the
wildest imaginings of the common man may as well be magic.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="plan">Release Plan</h2>
<p>Currently, the plan is to release this series in a manner that
resembles television, with episodes consisting of up to four chapters
and seasons about ten episodes long. Each novel of the series will be
analogous to a season of a show.</p>
<p>Each season will be initially free to read on <a
href="https://www.royalroad.com">Royal Road</a> and <a
href="https://www.wattpad.com">Wattpad</a>. When the next season is
ready to be posted, the old season will be published both in Ebook and
print editions, while the versions in their original, online locations
will become one or two episode teasers.</p>
<p>The first season is done and the first chapter was published on
Monday, January 6, 2025. The rest will follow a chapter at a time, every
Monday, Wednesday and Friday.</p>

href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/starwitch.html">Starwitch</a>.</p>
<p>The series begins with Amelia Blackwell, a witch with little magic
talent, but a keen mind, described by the previous owner of The Book as
a prodigy. She accepts ownership of it with curiosity and a voracious
desire to read all she can.</p>
<p>The Book soon gets Amelia and her two older sisters into all sorts of
trouble, because the depth of knowledge Amelia demonstrates breeds
jealousy, strife and accusations of witchcraft for all the wrong
reasons.</p>
<p>Eventually, Amelia constructs a vessel she names <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/starwitch.html">Starwitch</a> and the sisters flee the moon they
once called home, to seek peace among the stars. Instead, they find even
greater strife and a hostile pirate queen that consumes the souls of
witches to extend her own life.</p>

<p><span class="book-cover"><img

<em>Legacy of Newts</em> and will involve dealing with the consequences
of events from volume one.</p>
<p>Having defeated the pirate queen to rescue her sisters from serving
as fuel for that ancient witch’s life, Amelia flees, but the undead
witch is furious beyond measure and gives chase, determined to run them
down.</p>
<p>The sisters seek assistance from everyone they’ve befriended at every
port along the way, but no one has any desire to get between the sisters
and their powerful enemy.</p>
<p>There’s soon fighting in every corner of the star system, because the
Dead Queen’s lieutenants smell blood in the water. Things are poised to
go from bad to worse, because sometimes the devil you know is better
than the one waiting to fill the power vacuum…</p>

<p><span class="book-cover"><img

<em>The Next Horizon</em>. It will provide greater detail on The Book
and the way it interacts with Amelia.</p>
<p>After settling the matter of the pirates, Amelia and her sisters
enjoy a short time of peace, until she begins having dreams and visions
that reveal the way to travel from one star to the next, because The
Book has finally grown impatient.</p>
<p>Amelia initially resists, because she desires to return to the moon
she was born on, that she might reconnect with a man she fell in love
with, but The Book won’t leave her alone and becomes a source of great
frustration.</p>
<p>When the conflict comes to a head, The Book refuses to cooperate and
takes back the gifts it’s been quietly imparting. As a result, Amelia
discovers it has been bolstering her exceptional ability with
mathematics and piloting. Left to her own devices, the task of
navigating space becomes potentially deadly, because she can no longer
perform the required calculations in her head.</p>
<p>The journey home becomes perilous and tediously long, compared to
just days before, as everything that can get in the way does and she’s
forced to repeatedly check her math on paper, because her life is on the
line.</p>
<p>Just as Amelia and her sisters are struggling with that, they
encounter a duo of deadly witches they left behind and hoped never to
see again, who have since learned to fly through space and wish for a
helping of revenge.</p>
<p>Will Amelia survive long enough to reignite the love she once had, or
will she be forced to give up her greatest desire, just to satisfy The
Book?</p>

<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/../../images/Cover-Witchhome.jpg" /></span> In volume four, titled
<em>Witchhome</em>, Amelia will arrive at a compromise with The Book
they can both live with.</p>
<p>Amelia builds a magic, flying city to serve as a home and place of
refuge while she explores space, a compromise between her desire to put
down roots and the ceaseless need of The Book to go further.</p>
<p>Her massive construction project soon draws attention from all over
the system. Witches and wizards flock to her cause, drawn like moths to
a flame by the potential. Dwarves first supply the resources required,
but soon see the allure of the project and lend a helping hand, that
they might find the same kind of refuge from prejudice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it isn’t all good news, and the locals of Amelia’s
home moon soon rise up, to burn the “cursed city of witches” to the
ground. To avoid all-out war, Amelia’s people are forced to launch
early, before even basic safety measures can be tested.</p>
<p>Will Amelia manage to have her cake and eat it too, or will all the
troubles she seeks to escape finally catch up to her? Will her people be
able to finish their work along the way, or will <em>Witchhome</em> come
apart before they can reach assistance?</p>

<em>Beyond the Horizon</em>, Amelia will finally begin exploring, as the
means to find a place her people can call home.</p>
<p>Amelia flies her magic city full of brave witches, wizards and
dwarves to unexplored space, for the sake of establishing a colony where
they won’t be persecuted for their magical talents.</p>
<p>They carry with them seeds and animals of every kind, with which to
make a new home, plus a population composed of every walk of life,
including every skill that might be required both along the way and at
their destination.</p>
<p>The journey is perilous beyond measure, with strange encounters
aplenty, including lethal space weather, aliens with unfathomable
motives and a hazardous encounter with a black hole.</p>
<p>Will Amelia’s people be able to find a world suitable for
terraforming and the construction of a new home, or will their journey
end with disaster, for over-reaching their grasp? Will Amelia be able to
resist naming that planet Witchworld?</p>

Royal Road</a></span> Nicole Jacobs is twenty years old and unsure what
direction to take in life, because the opportunities available to her
are too numerous and no one job fits all of her talents, but she passes
the time doing research on dragons. To that end, she hatches a dragon
egg, but in the midst of the harrowing work required, she dreams of the
ancient, magical City of Kurg, which yearns to be whole.</p>
<p>She soon discovers, based on a chance encounter with a small magic
item she’d been analyzing, that her mind has been dangerously
intertwined with that of the city, which spreads through her brain like
a disease, slowly taking over. At first, she’s able to keep it under
control by suppressing magic within her own head, but over time, it
begins breaking past the road blocks she desperately erects in its path
as it inches toward total control.</p>
<p>Seeking a cure, she’s forced to research the ancient city, while the
clock ticks down on her sanity and ultimately, her life. Meeting the
strange, stone men that made the city, the Ulkun, she finds they have
few answers for her, but suggest that if she locates the Architect of
Kurg, one of their own kind, he might be of some help. Unfortunately,
due to the fact he was trapped inside a small segment of the sealed city
for millions of years, alone, he’s quite insane, unhelpful and worse,
eventually becomes hostile, forming a plan for galactic domination.</p>
<p>Instead, Nicole seeks the Life Giver, the mysterious being that
created the Ulkun and ordered the construction of Kurg, while collecting
pieces of the city, in the hopes of attracting their attention.</p>
<p>Will Nicole find a cure, freeing herself from the clutches of Kurg,
or will she she lose control of her own mind, taken over by the magic
city? Will the Architect succeed at replacing everyone in the galaxy
with obedient, magically-animated drones with no will of their own or
will Nicole stop him?</p>

her twentieth birthday, but during analysis of the strange, magic
trinket, she accidentally copies the magic item’s base spell into her
mind, where it rapidly expands beyond the original design, slowly
consuming her mind from the inside! Nicole reluctantly seeks out the
maker of the item, hoping to find a cure before it’s too late to save

<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-FeyFighters.jpg" /></span> Forced to give up
their original home due to the constant incursions of humans, the
fairies long ago retreated from Earth to an out of the way corner of the
galaxy to live in peace, but when humans accidentally stumble upon them,
they aren’t happy and this time, they’re not willing to give up their
home without fighting until either the extinction of themselves or the
human invaders!</p>
<p>However, nothing’s as it seems, because the humans only arrived as
the result of a series of accidents, having been forced to make an
unsafe faster-than-light jump through space to the nearest potentially
habitable system, which resulted in the destruction of their star ship!
With nowhere else to go and faced with the hostile locals, they
staunchly defend themselves against constant fey assault.</p>
<p>Two soldiers on opposite sides, pixie Commander Stargazer Candleflash
and human Sergeant Edwin Harris, find their fates forever entwined,
first by hatred and the desire for revenge, but then, as they crash
together in a rainforest full of danger, they’re forced to work
together, just to survive.</p>
<p>Will these two rivals, who have every reason to hate each other,
survive or will their bickering get them killed? Is it possible a
fragile peace can be forged from their own personal cease-fire or will
the doomsday weapons held by both sides be released, ensuring the
destruction of everyone?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
</blockquote>
<p>On a distant planet tucked away in a barely explored region of the
galaxy, war breaks out between humans that are forced to land there and
the fairies that left Earth during World War II, because the human race
had become too violent to share a planet with.</p>
<p><em>Fey Fighters</em> introduces true fairies to the setting, who
will also be seen in volume three, where they’ll play a vital role
providing exposition and will also play a part in <em>The Great
Purpose</em>, due to the linked nature of both demons and fey.</p>

<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-CollectorOfKurg.jpg" /></span> Having accepted
the fact that the City of Kurg is permanently bonded to her mind and
soul, Nicole seeks to collect all of the missing fragments of the
magical city, both on and off her home planet, soon coming into conflict
with rogue trolls, ancient monsters, aliens, gun-slinging snails,
monkeys with crossbows, giants and even fairies.</p>
<p><em>Collector of Kurg</em> will bring Nicole’s adopted mother,
Cha’da, into the series, as Nicole encounters her sailing the wilds of
the world’s ocean.</p>
<p>This one is likely to be a collection of short, but connected tales,
rather than a novel, with each planet visited being its own story.</p>

<h2 id="baba-yaga-lives">Baba Yaga Lives!</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-BabaYagaLives.jpg" /></span> Baba Yaga started
out wanting to live a little longer, falling to the temptations of
necromancy to extend her life, gaining a mere decade or so with each
human soul she consumes. Eventually growing dissatisfied with such
meager fare, she turns her attention to consuming the souls of magical
creatures for the extra power they contain and her body slowly becomes
more magic than flesh, transforming her into a thaumavore.</p>
<p>However, with the rise of science and magical creatures of the galaxy
growing wise to her tricks, there’s precious little for her to eat. She
can’t afford the hefty price enchanted items sell for on the galactic
market and finds their weak magic unsatisfying, anyway, but she does
come across a rare and undervalued curio: one of the hexagonal coins
that make up the magical City of Kurg, an object so impossibly filled
with magic, it has the power to resist her every attempt to consume
it!</p>
<p>She seeks to unlock the hidden power of the coin, hoping to extend
her life until the end of time with its nearly limitless magic.
Unfortunately for her, not just anyone can access the magic of Kurg,
something only a city administrator can do. Learning this fact by
touching the mind of the coin, she seeks a conversation with Nicole, the
only available administrator.</p>
<p>Nicole’s quest to collect the missing pieces of the City of Kurg
brings her right to Baba Yaga’s doorstep and since their goals are
nothing alike and totally at odds, the meeting devolves into a magical
duel! War for ownership of the city follows, eventually leading to a
sprawling battle inside the legendary chicken-legged hut of Baba Yaga, a
magically-folded, mind-bending space that would give even M. C. Escher a
headache!</p>
<p>Will Nicole overcome the crone’s superior, time-tested spells or will
Nicole, as an extension of Kurg, become Baba Yaga’s living larder?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Baba Yaga Lives!</em> will bring legendary magical creatures to
the city, including Levi’s old familiar, Inorath, because Nicole will
need information on Baba Yaga and many of them are even older than the
ancient witch.</p>
<h2 id="the-great-purpose">The Great Purpose</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-TheGreatPurpose.jpg" /></span> In this volume of
<em>Jigsaw City</em>, the true purpose of Kurg is revealed: it was
designed as a powerful weapon for fighting a war that’s as old as the
universe. The Life Giver is back, in need of Nicole and her city’s
power, while the Life Giver’s nemesis, The Void, attempts to invade the
Milky Way, to begin consuming everyone and everything there.</p>
<p><em>The Great Purpose</em> will bring the Hunter from <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../ashen-blades/index.html">Ashen Blades</a> to the city, to
combat a nearly limitless supply of demons, because they’ve finally
succeeded in opening a stable portal to the galaxy. It will also involve
the Hunter’s arch-nemesis, Vogerath, since the portal was his plan.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

<h2 id="lost-city">Lost City</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-LostCity.jpg" /></span> Nicole and the Hunter
may have won the battle with demon-kind and The Void, but the cost is
extremely high: Nicole sacrifices her life for the success of their
crazy suicide mission and the Hunter finally reaches the limits of both
her demon and witch powers, with disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Nicole’s body is restored by automatic functions of the City of Kurg,
but her mind is shattered by re-birth as its living avatar. Lost,
confused and alone, will Nicole ever return to her home and those she
loves or will she forever wander a dying, parallel universe, seeking a
home she can’t even remember?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Hunter is also lost and alone, but in immediate peril.
She emerges from the spatial tear formed by The Void’s final kick at
thirty-thousand feet above a strange, alien planet, with absolutely no
idea where she is. Even worse, she’s lost the power of the elements and
been left to her own devices, totally unable to fly. Will she survive
the fall and find some way to get home or will she remain forever
lost?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="the-memory-hunt">The Memory Hunt</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>Nicole discovers the fact that her memories were backed up by the
city before she was killed, but unlike her body, it was unable to fully
restore her mind.</p>
<p>Seeking to regain a greater measure of humanity, Nicole goes back to
collecting lost fragments of the City of Kurg, mostly for the sake of
restoring her memories.</p>
<p>This takes her beyond the galaxy she knows, to far-flung areas of the
multiverse, because when the ancient city broke up, parts of it left the
galaxy, while some few traveled to parallel universes.</p>

After the hornet’s nest Zechariah Jacobs kicked, by revealing the dark
secrets of the Northwestern Galactic Empire, all he wants is to get
home, but that may not be so easy. The Imperial Intelligence Core is out
for blood and more committed then ever to killing Zech, that they might
more reasonably claim his evidence of the colony they nuked is
false.</p>
<p>Zech and the crew of his star ship battle their way home by the skin
of their teeth, only for Zech to get some awful news: the Empire has
sent an entire fleet, which is packed to the gills with thermonuclear
ordnance and their primary mission is to glass the planet.</p>
<p>Zech and friends seek all the allies they can get, reaching out to
ogres and a remote village that turns out to be far more than meets the
eye, while an ex-pirate officer of his ship requests space pirate and
even alien aid. Meanwhile, Zech and the wizard he’s apprenticed to work
to mix magic and technology, to build weapons they hope will turn the
tide of war, including teleporters, energy shields and multifunction
guns that shoot spells, based on software.</p>
<p>Friendly ships arrive in orbit to help, but in too few numbers,
compared to the colossal fleet the Empire has fielded. Will Zech and his
friends survive the terrible fury of the Empire or will they lose
everything they love, including the very ground they stand on?</p>

<a href="https://books2read.com/SkyChildren">Store Links</a></span> In a
far-flung future where humans have colonized much of the galaxy,
Zechariah Jacobs is a colonist sent out by the Northwestern Empire,
aboard a star ship destined for the frontier, but there’s a rebellion on
board and he’s forced to scuttle the ship, on the captain’s orders.</p>
<p>Launching an escape pod, Zechariah lands alone, on an “unexplored”
planet. Knowing help is months, if not years away, he explores. He finds
plant and animal life remarkably similar to what his colony ship would
have seeded and shortly after encounters remarkably human-looking
natives, with pointed ears!</p>
<p>As he’s taught the local language, he learns the forest-dwelling
locals are elves and just beyond the hill is a village of dwarves. He’s
introduced to the dwarves and their leader, Winzon, who calls himself a
“history miner.” Winzon takes him to one of his best finds: an ancient
wrecked space fighter, that’s thousands of years old!</p>
<p>Zechariah accesses the black box, discovering his people used a
quarantine as an excuse to nuke one of their own colonies from orbit,
seeing awful images of the fighter gunning down the survivors, leaving
him wondering why!</p>
<p>Almost as if in answer, he catches an illness called “Mind Fire,”
which grants him strange, magic powers that defy science!</p>
<p>Using magic and technology, he helps Winzon’s search for more tech,
eventually discovering a star ship! Feeling disquieted by what they
know, they gather a crew for the ship, teach them using software left in
the ship’s computer, then go on a mission to visit one of the Empire’s
media hubs, to share all they know with the public.</p>
<p>Will they get the truth out or will the crew of the ship become the
most recent in a long line of victims snuffed out by the empire’s secret
cover-up operation?</p>

Peace and quiet to think and grieve, that’s all the Hunter wanted, but
between old enemies with agendas of their own, angry elemental spirits
and her own friends never quite knowing when to leave her be, that
elusive moment of quiet contemplation is always just out of reach.</p>
<p>The Hunter’s journey began with the loss of her best friend, the only
man that was ever a father figure to her, which reminds her of losing
the first real friend she ever had, because the two private detectives
had much in common and the similarities compound her grief.</p>
<p>She walks the surface of the Moon, for what better place could there
be to seek a quiet moment? Unfortunately, she soon faces an unexpected
demon that’s been trapped there for thousands of years. Next, she tries
a remote valley watched over by an ally, but the lonely woman pesters
the Hunter until she loses her temper and is forced to leave.</p>
<p>She wanders many remote and unusual corners of the world, always in
search of that moment of solitude, that she might reflect on the past,
but the arch-demon known as Wrath has taken a liking to her, and seeks
her hand in marriage. To that end, he posts a bounty for her capture and
the path to emotional healing becomes a frustrating battlefield.</p>
<p>She seeks the mythic last of all sanctuaries, but instead finds a
half-demon girl much like herself, and a quest to help the lonely child
connect with family.</p>
<p>In the midst of the Hunter’s busy and frenetic life, will she find a
moment to grieve her two best friends and learn to move on, or will all
of creation forever stand in the way?</p>

<p>Currently, my plans for the next installment of this series have not
yet been set and are completely up in the air regarding both which novel
is next and even the title of the most likely option.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I have the plot for <a

out in my head, but the trouble with this one is that I’m not sure how
to research Japan properly, to write it, because I want that to be the
setting. Ideally, I’d like to go there for a research trip, but I can’t
afford that. The next best alternative is interviewing someone that has
spent time there, but I don’t know anyone that has.</p>

<p>The last option is <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-hunts-gremlins">She Hunts

is, I prefer this one to come after the other two, because the novel

Plagued by horrific nightmares, the consequences of war and reeling from
the loss of his family, the Steel Wizard, Levi Jacobs copes by throwing
himself into work, but old enemies gain the power to travel through
time, refusing to give him a moment to grieve. Making matters worse, an
impatient and violent alien pirate lurks in orbit.</p>
<p>Far from friendly, the alien pirate is boiling with rage over several
massive blows to his pride at the hands of humanoids. Unable to kill
those responsible, instead he plots revenge on their child, Levi, and
everyone around him, to regain face in the eyes of his own kind, for
whom personal pride is literally everything, including social ranking
and the right to rule.</p>

<p>Levi hated the monster from under the bed as a child, but when he
meets the creature as a young adult, he quickly learns nothing will be
the same in his life, ever again. The creature of darkness pleads for
his aid in a coming war and the young wizard reluctantly agrees, making
it his familiar.</p>
<p>Levi’s family and friends are soon caught up in a galaxy-wide war to
decide the fate of humanity and continually come face to face with
monsters straight out of myth and legend, including the dreaded Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse! The old gods and monsters humanity revered
before the rise of science and reason are angry over being ignored and
seek to force humanity to believe in them once more!</p>
<p>The young wizard’s allies find themselves in a unique position to
fight the supernatural creatures, since they’re gifted with magical
powers of their own, soon sparking a wave of resistance from the
governments of the galaxy, as they take the fight to the legends!</p>
<p>However, the battle isn’t easy, because the forgotten legends weren’t
idle over the millennia, having built an impressive manufacturing
facility that draws matter straight from a star to build warships at an
incredible rate, churning them out faster than humanity can deal with!
Worse yet, these ships have the very best in weaponry that both magic
and science can produce.</p>
<p>Will Levi and his family overcome the endless waves of disposable
warships or will the governments of the galaxy be crushed by the Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse, beginning an era of slavery under the heel
of their own forgotten legends?</p>

The Steel Wizard, Captain Levi Jacobs, is woken in the night by his
pregnant wife, with happy news their child is coming, but joy becomes
tragedy as she dies in childbirth. Reeling from this loss, he vows to
raise their daughter to be a strong hero, just like her mother, but even
that fleeting comfort is stolen from the bittersweet moment as the poor
infant struggles to breathe and dies in his arms!</p>
<p>Reeling at the loss, he staggers from one defeat to the next, slowly
losing everything else he cares about.</p>
<p>Finally, after a particularly traumatic defeat at the hands of a new
enemy, followed by a prolonged kidnapping involving the forced
administration of narcotics to make him complaint, he lies in the

withdrawal. Just when he’s at an all-time low, he’s offered a ray of
unusual hope, reminded that he once witnessed his future self travel

<p>Armed with this memory, he focuses to unlock the secrets of temporal
magic, intent on undoing months of terrible events, only to find it’s
not so easy, because he has to fight to gain the approval of the Moirai,

which Zechariah crash lands on an ‘unexplored’ planet, only to uncover a

<description><![CDATA[<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/characters/ashen-blades/ArtemisWatson-15Years-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson, in 1945" /></span></p>
<h1 id="artemis-watson">Artemis Watson</h1>
<p>Artemis Watson is the protagonist in the series <a
href="https://owentyme.us/characters/ashen-blades/../../books/book-of-newts/index.html">Ashen Blades</a>, though
more technically, she has no name.</p>
<p>She has brown hair, extremely blue eyes and an obsession with wearing
the color black. She always wears the top hat she inherited from her
father. She also perpetually wears gloves. For preference, she prefers
elbow-length, fingerless gloves. This might initially seem to be a
stylistic choice, but there are <a href="https://owentyme.us/characters/ashen-blades/artemis-watson.html#psychology">deeply
psychological reasons for this</a>. She is technically a goth, but she
was dressing that way before the term became popular. In her own mind,
she once thought, “Black is where it’s at.”</p>
<p>She’s a half-demon, half-human girl that was born in 1897, in New
York City. Her mother was a demon witch and her father was a demon
hunter, more specifically an Ashen Blade, which is an organization
dedicated to hunting and eliminating demons on Earth, for the sake of
humanity. This gives her both the powers of a demon and a witch, two
forms of magic that are stronger together.</p>
<p>Artemis looks entirely human at a glance, but that’s only because she
always wears a skirt that hides her tail, which tends to twitch in time
to her mood, much like that of a cat. Combined with the tendency of her
eyes to easily reflect light, a little thought can bring one to the
conclusion she has some traits in common with cats. This is because her
mother had feline traits in demon form, though her demon form was the
size and shape of a regular house cat.</p>
<p>She suffers from a curse from a demon that makes her unable to say
anything other than “It’s a secret”, which tends to really irritate her.
As such, she’s really embraced rude gestures as one of her favorite ways
to communicate.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of demons and the way their true names can be used
to compel them, Artemis was never actually named by her parents and all
the ways that others refer to her are merely nicknames. Personally, she
calls herself ‘the Hunter’, because she considers all demons prey and
has made killing them all her mission in life.</p>
<p>The black market arms dealer she bought her guns from in the 1940’s
gave her the nickname ‘Little Miss Secret’, based on the only thing she
can say. She was always fond of him, so she loves that nickname. Her
friends often shorten it to just ‘LMS’.</p>
<p>During the third book, she was briefly able to speak her mind and her
private detective partner chose to name her Artemis, rather than calling
her ‘the Hunter’, because that sounded more like a title than a name to
him. Her last name comes from her father, Jake Watson.</p>
<p>Artemis is mischievous, but often cheerful and smiles a lot, at least
when she isn’t angry. Unfortunately, she’s often quite angry. She’s
prone to playing practical jokes, especially with grumpy and serious
people. With demons, her mischievous side becomes extremely cruel,
because she hates them so much.</p>
<p>This is another area in which she takes after a cat and she sometimes
tortures demons to death the way a cat plays with a mouse, though she’s
grown slightly less cruel over time, because demons have sometimes
escaped from her during such moments, leading to her giving them quicker
deaths as she’s grown more mature.</p>
<p>Like a cat, Artemis is extremely smell-oriented, with an ability to
discern humans from demons by scent. She can also use her heightened
sense of smell to fight blind, which gives her great advantages in a
fight.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="special-powers">Special Powers</h2>
<p>Artemis has the powers of both a demon and a witch, though she leans
more heavily on her demon powers, because they came with useful
instincts that tell her how to use them.</p>
<p>Her witch powers have been much slower to mature, but so far, she’s
demonstrated fire magic hot enough to produce blue flame and smoke
magic.</p>
<p>Her demon powers give her the ability to teleport between shadows,
extreme physical durability, great strength, super-human speed and an
enhanced sense of smell. Hypothetically, she’ll also never die of old
age.</p>
<p>Artemis is fond of combining her ability to teleport with her sense
of smell in the dark, allowing her to teleport from enemy to enemy in a
fashion that leaves her opponents terrified about where she might pop up
next.</p>
<p>One of her least favorite powers is the ability to consume demons to
recharge her magical reserves, which is something demons sometimes do to
each other, when they’re feeling peckish. She can’t stand the taste of
them, however.</p>
<p>She combines smoke magic with demon magic to produce solid magical
projections of objects stored in her hat.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/characters/ashen-blades/AnnmarieNossett-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of the mother of Artemis Watson, who&#39;s named Annmarie Nossett" /></span></p>
<p>The spirit of her mother acts as a living protective spell that that
keeps the world at arms-length from Artemis, unless she chooses to let
someone in.</p>
<p>Anyone that tries to touch her befalls a mysterious, magical accident
brought on by probability manipulation magic. Anyone that intends her
harm tends to experience a deadly accident. Demons are rarely killed by
this effect, due to how durable they are, but it can still be quite
damaging to them.</p>
<p>However, the spell isn’t perfect: indirect attacks and strikes can
hit her.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/characters/ashen-blades/JakeWatson-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of the mother of Artemis Watson, who&#39;s named Annmarie Nossett" /></span></p>
<p>The spirit of her dead father is bound to her hat, which she
subconsciously turned into a portal to a pocket dimension. Her father
manages manipulating space and sometimes even time for her, extending
the level of control she can exert over the interior of her hat, as well
as the precision with with she can manipulate the contents.</p>
<p>The space inside her hat is fairly large and she once stored an
entire military jeep within it.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p>Her most powerful magical technique is a combination of witch fire
magic and demonic void magic, which produces what’s known as the
all-consuming flame. This is so hot, it glows in the ultraviolet
spectrum and most anything that’s hit by it is burned to nothingness.
Demons that are struck by this are effectively consumed by Artemis,
giving her a short-term boost to her magic powers.</p>
<p>The all-consuming flame is one of the few ways she knows of to
permanently kill a demon, who normally return to Hell when killed, then
seek to return to Earth.</p>
<p>She’s encountered many nature spirits over the years, each of which
serves as the avatar of a single element. In 1972, the Wood Spirit (AKA
the Jungle Spirit) picked a fight with her and the end result was
Artemis gaining access to its powers, which gave her the power to
transform into a huge, black cat or to armor her clothing with iron wood
panels, coming to resemble an armored knight with a shield.</p>
<p>She’s since had similar experiences with Water, Air and Metal.</p>
<p>The Water Spirit gave her the power to turn into a massive,
black-skinned shark and other water-related powers she has little use
for, aside from the ability to breathe underwater and survive the
pressure at any depth, which is sometimes handy, since she never did
like using scuba gear.</p>
<p>The Air Spirit gave her the power to control air currents and fly.
She can also create bursts of air in a vacuum or refresh stale air,
which allowed her to breathe on the Moon. Hypothetically, she might be
able to turn into a large, black bird, but she’s never tried to.</p>
<p>The Metal Spirit gave her the power to encase herself in metal at
will and presumably the ability to control metal objects. She once used
its power to cover her clothes in armor plates composed of alternating
layers of titanium and tungsten, for much greater durability than her
iron wood armor, at a mere fraction of the weight.</p>
<h2 id="favored-weapons-and-equipment">Favored Weapons and
Equipment</h2>
<p>Artemis started out using various discarded kitchen knives she
rescued from the trash, with a clear favorite being a full-size
butcher’s knife. These were later supplemented with a baseball bat and
ball. Unfortunately, the ball and bat were destroyed fighting
demons.</p>
<p>In more modern times, Artemis has mostly switched to guns that fire
.45 rounds, because they have enough punch to put a hole through a
skull, which is the only way to kill a demon. She has an M1911 pistol
and a Thompson sub-machine gun. The Tommy gun is her favorite, but due
to the expense of full-auto fire, the rest of the detective agency she
works with have convinced her to use it only when necessary.</p>
<p>She eventually replaced the baseball bat with a Japanese wakizashi
that has a blue hilt wrapping and a tsuba (hilt guard) in the shape of
an open, blue rose. This has so far proven to be durable enough to
withstand her full demonic strength. She often projects her
all-consuming flame onto the blade, which extends her reach.</p>
<p>Here’s the (mostly) untold story of this sword: it was originally a
show piece made to hang on a wall, but the smith that made it still took
the work seriously, because even a decorative weapon might be needed
during a home invasion. The last of its Japanese owners immigrated to
the United States before World War II, but as things became difficult
for Japanese, they needed money and pawned it. When the war got even
more serious, the shop had a hard time selling it and Artemis picked it
up for a bargain price.</p>
<p>When Artemis needs heavier weapons, she has a .50 Browning M2 machine
gun with a shoulder strap to give it a little extra stabilization, which
she’s strong enough to fire from the hip. The few opponents that were
unlucky enough to see this weapon didn’t last long.</p>
<p>Her biggest and most ridiculous weapon is an M168 Vulcan Cannon,
which is normally vehicle mounted, but she can just barely manage to
fire it from the hip, though she isn’t very accurate with it, because
it’s just too big. On the other hand, considering the rate of fire that
thing is capable of, she tends to spray and pray. She mostly keeps it
for the sake of her gun collection, rather than considering it a useful
weapon, though a small number of demons have been on the receiving end
of it, on occasions when she <em>really</em> lost her temper. She rarely
has ammunition for it, because the bullets are not available at sane
prices.</p>
<p>Her top hat is one of her most prized possessions, because it
belonged to her father. It contains a pocket dimension, which holds all
of her other possessions and serves as the home of her mother’s
familiar, Mashu’ra, a juvenile demon in the form of a kitten. Mashu’ra
serves Artemis by looking after and caring for her weapons, including
reloading her guns, though no one is quite sure how a kitten manages
that.</p>
<p>In 1972, the Wood Spirit (AKA Jungle Spirit) gave Artemis some magic
clothes that change shape at a whim and are durable enough to act as
light body armor that can stop bullets. They also clean and repair
themselves. They can take on just about any style, including useful
forms like a space suit or hazmat gear.</p>
<p>In 1986, the Water Spirit gave her a shark-tooth necklace that really
doesn’t match her usual style of accessories, but she <em>does</em>
reluctantly wear it. It hasn’t yet displayed any magical abilities, but
it may in the future.</p>
<p>In 2024, the Air Spirit gave her a decorative, silver comb, which
came with the incidental power to alter her hair style and color at
will. She uses it to change her hair color as her mood changes, or as
her twisted and black sense of fashion dictates. She tends to pick
somber colors that match her goth-like persona, including blue, when she
was depressed. However, when Alice emerged and took control of their
body, her hair turned blond (see the section on <a
href="https://owentyme.us/characters/ashen-blades/artemis-watson.html#psychology">Psychology</a> for more information).</p>
<p>Also in 2024, the Metal Spirit gave her a bracelet with black,
cast-iron plates linked by stainless steel chain. It hasn’t yet
displayed any magical abilities, but it may in the future. She isn’t one
for jewelry, but she does like this accessory, since the Metal Spirit
was wise enough to recognize her sense of style, unlike the Water
Spirit.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-growth">Early Life and Growth</h2>
<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/characters/ashen-blades/ArtemisWatson-10Years-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson, in 1922" /></span></p>
<p>At the age of three years old, in the year 1900, her parents were
murdered by a demon in front of her, but due to her mother’s magic,
their spirits were bound to her. Her mother, Annmarie, turned herself
into a living, protective spell.</p>
<p>The father of Artemis was also killed, but his spirit was bound to
his top hat, a favorite item. This is the same top hat Artemis
wears.</p>
<p>Artemis has followed a rather unusual pattern of growth all her life:
she doesn’t grow older until she emotionally matures, then her body
changes fairly instantly, to match her mental state.</p>
<p>For example, when she was twenty-five years old, she looked ten,
because in all that time, she never quite matured enough to progress any
further.</p>
<p>In 1922, she had a chance encounter with a private detective, demon
hunter and Ashen Blade named Reggie Stewart. At the time, she was little
more than a remorseless killing machine that preyed on the demons of New
York City, using a butcher’s knife.</p>
<p>In that first encounter, she stole one of Reggie’s pistols, her very
first gun, which she’s never given up.</p>
<p>Upon learning of the man’s dangerous job, she began following him and
eventually realized she’d found a kindred spirit. They became partners
and together, they really cleaned up the streets of New York.</p>
<p>While they were together, Artemis matured until she resembled a girl
of fifteen years, though she remained short and petite, at only five
feet tall.</p>
<p>Eventually, in 1942, Reggie was killed and the Ashen Blades assigned
her a new detective partner: Clayton Simmons.</p>

<p>She really didn’t mature much over the next few decades, until the
two of them went to Vietnam, in 1972, to exterminate an arch-demon that
had come to Earth.</p>
<p>While they were there, Artermis had a rough experience with the death
of a solider and got human blood on her hands, leading to an emotional
breakdown, but when she eventually recovered, she grew a little
older.</p>

<p>In book three, the curse that prevents her from speaking her mind was
briefly lifted and she was able to speak with her father. After that
emotional experience, she once again grew a little older.</p>
<p>In book four, after the loss of a dear friend, the grieving process
finally fully took her into adulthood, because she was forced to discard
some very childish coping mechanisms in order to heal.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="psychology">Psychology</h2>
<p>Due to the hardships of being a half-demon and the trauma Artemis has
experienced, she isn’t exactly mentally stable. In point of fact, she
has multiple personalities.</p>
<p>The first is The Hunter, which is her base personality. The Hunter
represents her ego.</p>
<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/characters/ashen-blades/ArtemisWatson-TheDemon-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson in her demonic form" /></span></p>
<p>The second is her inner demon, which she’s spent a lifetime fighting
to contain, because this personality is a murderous creature with no
moral compass. The demon is more or less her Id, an emotional creature
with no self-control.</p>
<p>The one time the demon gained full control of their body, she
transformed into a humanoid cat monster absolutely brimming with muscle,
which is more or less the demonic form of Artemis.</p>
<p>In that battle, the demon also publicly declared its name: The Eighth
Deadly Sin, Willful Insanity. She goes by Insanity, for short.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, Insanity was born the day Reggie Stewart was killed,
because Artemis completely lost control of herself, only coming to her
senses after the mixed group of demons and humans was defeated, with the
humans fleeing, while the demons were…extremely dead, with evidence of
claws and teeth.</p>
<p>Reggie witnessed the incident before he died and spoke as if he was
impressed, but Artemis has no memory of it.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, Insanity has a fondness for Jake, their father.</p>
<p>Insanity and the Hunter have a rather unusual relationship, in that
they hate and love each other, but neither of them would have it any
other way. When they face outside threats to their mind, like telepathic
attacks, they usually face them together, despite the way Insanity
insists she’ll someday eat the Hunter.</p>
<p>What it comes down to is a matter of predator and prey dynamics, in
which Insanity has claimed the Hunter as prey, so Insanity refuses to
let anyone else kill her.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/characters/ashen-blades/ArtemisWatson-Alice-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson, as Alice" /></span></p>
<p>During the climax of book four, Artemis was splashed with
approximately an entire pint of LSD, which resulted in the emergence of
a third personality, who calls herself Alice, due to a song that was
playing at the time (<em>White Rabbit</em>, by Jefferson Airplane). Due
to how confused she was at the time, she took on an approximation of the
appearance of Alice from <em>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</em>,
blond hair and all.</p>
<p>Alice cares for the Hunter like a sister and has demonstrated a
tendency to side with her against Insanity, helping to keep the demon
under control.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p>Quite aside from this, Artemis occasionally hallucinates that she has
blood on her hands, because she was there when Reggie died and got blood
all over them, which is why she wears gloves. This hallucination got
worse in 1972, when her gloves got splashed with blood.</p>
<p>When Artemis gets tremendously angry, beyond merely losing her
temper, her eyes glow. This is part of her demonic ancestry, though it
is exceptionally rare.</p>
<h2 id="travels">Travels</h2>
<p>Artemis hates to travel, because she gets extremely motion sick in
vehicles. However, she has visited a number of places, both in and out
of the United States, including White Sands and Carlsbad Cavern, both in
New Mexico, The Cauldron of the Elements (a remote volcanic caldera
somewhere in the United States, which once hosted a summer camp),
California, Kansas, Canada, The Amazon, Egypt, the bottom of the Mariana
trench, Mount Everest, Vietnam, Tokyo in Japan, Alice Springs in
Australia, a snowy mountainside that may have been in Tibet, the Moon,
and a pocket dimension known as The Last Sanctuary.</p>

title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson in a kimono, in 1972" /></span></p>
<p>Here’s a nice image of Artemis during her brief visit to Tokyo, while
her team was taking a break from fighting the demons hiding in the
jungles of Vietnam. On this occasion, her magic clothes went native
without her giving it much thought.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/characters/ashen-blades/ArtemisWatson-SummerCamp-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson in 1986, when she went to summer camp" /></span></p>
<p>In 1986, she went undercover at a summer camp that was infested with
demons. At the time, she was pretending to be a teenager, despite the
fact she was old enough to be the grandmother of the teens that
surrounded her. She got particularly cranky while she was there, because
she doesn’t like to interact with teenagers.</p>
