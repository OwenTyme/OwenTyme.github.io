After the hornet’s nest Zechariah Jacobs kicked, by revealing the dark
secrets of the Northwestern Galactic Empire, all he wants is to get
home, but that may not be so easy. The Imperial Intelligence Core is out
for blood and more committed then ever to killing Zech, that they might
more reasonably claim his evidence of the colony they nuked is
false.</p>
<p>Zech and the crew of his star ship battle their way home by the skin
of their teeth, only for Zech to get some awful news: the Empire has
sent an entire fleet, which is packed to the gills with thermonuclear
ordnance and their primary mission is to glass the planet.</p>
<p>Zech and friends seek all the allies they can get, reaching out to
ogres and a remote village that turns out to be far more than meets the
eye, while an ex-pirate officer of his ship requests space pirate and
even alien aid. Meanwhile, Zech and the wizard he’s apprenticed to work
to mix magic and technology, to build weapons they hope will turn the
tide of war, including teleporters, energy shields and multifunction
guns that shoot spells, based on software.</p>
<p>Friendly ships arrive in orbit to help, but in too few numbers,
compared to the colossal fleet the Empire has fielded. Will Zech and his
friends survive the terrible fury of the Empire or will they lose
everything they love, including the very ground they stand on?</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/characters/ashen-blades/ArtemisWatson-15Years-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson, in 1945" /></span></p>
<h1 id="artemis-watson">Artemis Watson</h1>
<p>Artemis Watson is the protagonist in the series <a
href="https://owentyme.us/characters/ashen-blades/../../books/book-of-newts/index.html">Ashen Blades</a>, though
more technically, she has no name.</p>
<p>She has brown hair, extremely blue eyes and an obsession with wearing
the color black. She always wears the top hat she inherited from her
father. She also perpetually wears gloves. For preference, she prefers
elbow-length, fingerless gloves. This might initially seem to be a
stylistic choice, but there are <a href="https://owentyme.us/characters/ashen-blades/artemis-watson.html#psychology">deeply
psychological reasons for this</a>. She is technically a goth, but she
was dressing that way before the term became popular. In her own mind,
she once thought, “Black is where it’s at.”</p>
<p>She’s a half-demon, half-human girl that was born in 1897, in New
York City. Her mother was a demon witch and her father was a demon
hunter, more specifically an Ashen Blade, which is an organization
dedicated to hunting and eliminating demons on Earth, for the sake of
humanity. This gives her both the powers of a demon and a witch, two
forms of magic that are stronger together.</p>
<p>Artemis looks entirely human at a glance, but that’s only because she
always wears a skirt that hides her tail, which tends to twitch in time
to her mood, much like that of a cat. Combined with the tendency of her
eyes to easily reflect light, a little thought can bring one to the
conclusion she has some traits in common with cats. This is because her
mother had feline traits in demon form, though her demon form was the
size and shape of a regular house cat.</p>
<p>She suffers from a curse from a demon that makes her unable to say
anything other than “It’s a secret”, which tends to really irritate her.
As such, she’s really embraced rude gestures as one of her favorite ways
to communicate.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of demons and the way their true names can be used
to compel them, Artemis was never actually named by her parents and all
the ways that others refer to her are merely nicknames. Personally, she
calls herself ‘the Hunter’, because she considers all demons prey and
has made killing them all her mission in life.</p>
<p>The black market arms dealer she bought her guns from in the 1940’s
gave her the nickname ‘Little Miss Secret’, based on the the only thing
she can say and she was always fond of him, so she loves that nickname.
Her friends often shorten it to just ‘LMS’.</p>
<p>During the third book, she was briefly able to speak her mind and her
private detective partner chose to name her Artemis, rather than calling
her ‘the Hunter’, because that sounded more like a title than a name to
him. Her last name comes from her father, Jake Watson.</p>
<p>Artemis is mischievous, but often cheerful and smiles a lot, at least
when she isn’t angry. Unfortunately, she’s often quite angry. She’s
prone to playing practical jokes, especially with grumpy and serious
people. With demons, her mischievous side becomes extremely cruel,
because she hates them so much.</p>
<p>This is another area in which she takes after a cat and she sometimes
tortures demons to death the way a cat plays with a mouse, though she’s
grown slightly less cruel over time, because demons have sometimes
escaped from her during such moments, leading to her giving them quicker
deaths.</p>
<p>Like a cat, Artemis is extremely smell-oriented, with an ability to
discern humans from demons by scent. She can also use her heightened
sense of smell to fight blind, which gives her great advantages in a
fight.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="special-powers">Special Powers</h2>
<p>Artemis has the powers of both a demon and a witch, though she leans
more heavily on her demon powers, because they came with useful
instincts that tell her how to use them.</p>
<p>Her witch powers have been much slower to mature, but so far, she’s
demonstrated fire magic hot enough to produce blue flame and smoke
magic.</p>
<p>Her demon powers give her the ability to teleport between shadows,
extreme physical durability, great strength, super-human speed and an
enhanced sense of smell. Hypothetically, she’ll also never die of old
age.</p>
<p>Artemis is fond of combining her ability to teleport with her sense
of smell in the dark, allowing her to teleport from enemy to enemy in a
fashion that leaves her opponents terrified about where she might pop up
next.</p>
<p>One of her least favorite powers is the ability to consume demons to
recharge her magical reserves, which is something demons sometimes do to
each other, when they’re feeling peckish. She can’t stand the taste of
them, however.</p>
<p>She combines smoke magic with demon magic to produce solid magical
projections of objects stored in her hat.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/characters/ashen-blades/AnnmarieNossett-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of the mother of Artemis Watson, who&#39;s named Annmarie Nossett" /></span></p>
<p>The spirit of her mother acts as a living protective spell that that
keeps the world at arms-length from Artemis, unless she chooses to let
someone in.</p>
<p>Anyone that tries to touch her befalls a mysterious, magical accident
brought on by probability manipulation magic. Anyone that intends her
harm tends to experience a deadly accident. Demons are rarely killed by
this effect, due to how durable they are, but it can still be quite
damaging to them.</p>
<p>However, the spell isn’t perfect: indirect attacks and strikes can
hit her.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/characters/ashen-blades/JakeWatson-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of the mother of Artemis Watson, who&#39;s named Annmarie Nossett" /></span></p>
<p>The spirit of her dead father is bound to her hat, which she
subconsciously turned into a portal to a pocket dimension. Her father
manages manipulating space and sometimes even time for her, extending
the level of control she can exert over the interior of her hat, as well
as the precision with with she can manipulate the contents.</p>
<p>The space inside her hat is fairly large and she once stored an
entire military jeep within it.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p>Her most powerful magical technique is a combination of witch fire
magic and demonic void magic, which produces what’s known as the
all-consuming flame. This is so hot, it glows in the ultraviolet
spectrum and most anything that’s hit by it is burned to nothingness.
Demons that are struck by this are effectively consumed by Artemis,
giving her a short-term boost to her magic powers.</p>
<p>The all-consuming flame is one of the few ways she knows of to
permanently kill a demon, who normally return to Hell when killed, then
seek to return to Earth.</p>
<p>She’s encountered many natures spirits over the years, each of which
serves as the avatar of a single element. In 1972, the Wood Spirit (AKA
the Jungle Spirit) picked a fight with her and the end result was
Artemis gaining access to its powers, which gave her the power to
transform into a huge, black cat or to armor her clothing with iron wood
panels, coming to resemble an armored knight with a shield.</p>
<p>She’s since had similar experiences with Water, Air and Metal.</p>
<p>The Water Spirit gave her the power to turn into a massive,
black-skinned shark and other water-related powers she has little use
for, aside from the ability to breathe underwater and survive the
pressure at any depth, which is sometimes handy, since she never did
like using scuba gear.</p>
<p>The Air Spirit gave her the power to fly, control air currents and to
fly. She can also create bursts of air in a vacuum or refresh stale air,
which allowed her to breathe on the Moon. Hypothetically, she might be
able to turn into a large, black bird, but she’s never tried to.</p>
<p>The Metal Spirit gave her the power to encase herself in metal at
will and presumably the ability to control metal objects. She once used
its power to cover her clothes in armor plates composed of alternating
layers of titanium and tungsten, for much greater durability than her
iron wood armor, at a mere fraction of the weight.</p>
<h2 id="favored-weapons-and-equipment">Favored Weapons and
Equipment</h2>
<p>Artemis started out using various discarded kitchen knives she
rescued from the trash, with a clear favorite being a full-size
butcher’s knife. These were later supplemented with a baseball bat and
ball. Unfortunately, the ball and bat were destroyed fighting
demons.</p>
<p>In more modern times, Artemis has mostly switched to guns that fire
.45 rounds, because they have enough punch to put a hole through a
skull, whcsh is the only way to kill a demon. She has an M1911 pistol
and a Thompson sub-machine gun. The Tommy gun is her favorite, but due
to the expense of full-auto fire, the rest of the detective agency she
works with have convinced her to use it only when necessary.</p>
<p>She eventually replaced the baseball bat with a Japanese wakizashi
that has a blue hilt wrapping and a tsuba (hilt guard) in the shape of
an open, blue rose. This has so far proven to be durable enough to
withstand her full demonic strength. She often projects her
all-consuming flame onto the blade, which extends her reach.</p>
<p>Here’s the (mostly) untold story of this sword: it was originally a
show piece made to hang on a wall, but the smith that made it still took
the work seriously, because even a decorative weapon might be needed
during a home invasion. The last of its Japanese owners immigrated to
the United States before World War II, but as things became difficult
for Japanese, they needed money and pawned it. When the war got even
more serious, the shop had a hard time selling it and Artemis picked it
up for a bargain price.</p>
<p>When Artemis needs heavier weapons, she has a .50 Browning M2 machine
gun with a shoulder strap to give it a little extra stabilization, which
she’s strong enough to fire from the hip. The few opponents that were
unlucky enough to see this weapon didn’t last long.</p>
<p>Her biggest and most ridiculous weapon is an M168 Vulcan Cannon,
which is normally vehicle mounted, but she can just barely manage to
fire it from the hip, though she isn’t very accurate with it, because
it’s just too big. On the other hand, considering the rate of fire that
thing is capable of, she tends to spray and pray. She mostly keeps it
for the sake of her gun collection, rather than considering it a useful
weapon, though a small number of demons have been on the receiving end
of it, on occasions when she <em>really</em> lost her temper. She rarely
has ammunition for it, because the bullets are not available at sane
prices.</p>
<p>Her top hat is one of her most prized possessions, because it
belonged to her father. It contains a pocket dimension, which holds all
of her other possessions and serves as the home of her mother’s
familiar, Mashu’ra, a juvenile demon in the form of a kitten. Mashu’ra
serves Artemis by looking after and caring for her weapons, including
reloading her guns, though no one is quite sure how a kitten manages
that.</p>
<p>In 1972, the Wood Spirit (AKA Jungle Spirit) gave Artemis some magic
clothes that change shape at a whim and are durable enough to act as
light body armor that can stop bullets. They also clean and repair
themselves. They can take on just about any style, including useful
forms like a space suit or hazmat gear.</p>
<p>In 1986, the Water Spirit gave her a shark-tooth necklace that really
doesn’t match her usual style of accessories, but she <em>does</em>
reluctantly wear it. It hasn’t yet displayed any magical abilities, but
it may in the future.</p>
<p>In 2024, the Air Spirit gave her a decorative, silver comb, which
came with the incidental power to alter her hair style and color at
will. She uses it to change her hair color as her mood changes, or as
her twisted and black sense of fashion dictates. She tends to picked
somber colors that match her goth-like persona, including blue, when she
was depressed. However, when Alice emerged and took control of their
body, her hair turned blond (see the section on <a
href="https://owentyme.us/characters/ashen-blades/artemis-watson.html#psychology">Psychology</a> for more information).</p>
<p>Also in 2024, the Metal Spirit gave her a bracelet with black,
cast-iron plates linked by stainless steel chain. It hasn’t yet
displayed any magical abilities, but it may in the future. She isn’t one
for jewelry, but she does like this accessory, since the Metal Spirit
was wise enough to recognize her sense of style, unlike the Water
Spirit.</p>

<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/characters/ashen-blades/ArtemisWatson-10Years-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson, in 1922" /></span></p>
<p>At the age of three years old, in the year 1900, her parents were
murdered by a demon in front of her, but due to her mother’s magic,
their spirits were bound to her. Her mother, Annmarie, turned herself
into a living, protective spell.</p>
<p>The father of Artemis was also killed, but his spirit was bound to
his top hat, a favorite item. This is the same top hat Artemis
wears.</p>
<p>Artemis has followed a rather unusual pattern of growth all her life:
she doesn’t grow older until she emotionally matures, then her body
changes fairly instantly, to match her mental state.</p>
<p>For example, when she was twenty-five years old, she looked ten,
because in all that time, she never quite matured enough to progress any
further.</p>
<p>In 1922, she had a chance encounter with a private detective, demon
hunter and Ashen Blade named Reggie Stewart. At the time, she was little
more than a remorseless killing machine that preyed on the demons of New
York City, using a butcher’s knife.</p>
<p>In that first encounter, she stole one of Reggie’s pistols, her very
first gun, which she’s never given up.</p>
<p>Upon leaning of the man’s dangerous job, she began following him and
eventually realized she’d found a kindred spirit. They became partners
and together, they really cleaned up the streets of New York.</p>
<p>While they were together, Artemis matured until she resembled a girl
of fifteen years, though she remained short and petite, at only five
feet tall.</p>
<p>Eventually, in 1942, Reggie was killed and the Ashen Blades assigned
her a new detective partner: Clayton Simmons.</p>

title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson, in 1972, during her trip to Vietnam" /></span></p>
<p>She really didn’t mature much over the next few decades, until the
two of them went to Vietnam, in 1972, to exterminate an arch-demon that
had come to Earth.</p>
<p>While they were there, Artermis had a rough experience with the death
of a solider and got human blood on her hands, leading to an emotional
breakdown, but when she eventually recovered, she grew a little
older.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

src="https://owentyme.us/characters/ashen-blades/ArtemisWatson-17Years-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson at a more mature age" /></span></p>
<p>In book three, the curse that prevents her from speaking her mind was
briefly lifted and she was able to speak with her father. After that
emotional experience, she once again grew a little older.</p>
<p>In book four, after the loss of a dear friend, the grieving process
finally fully took her into adulthood, because she was forced to discard
some very childish coping mechanisms in order to heal.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="psychology">Psychology</h2>
<p>Due to the hardships of being a half-demon and the trauma Artemis has
experienced, she isn’t exactly mentally stable. In point of fact, she
has multiple personalities.</p>
<p>The first is The Hunter, which is her base personality. The Hunter
represents her ego.</p>
<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/characters/ashen-blades/ArtemisWatson-TheDemon-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson in her demonic form" /></span></p>
<p>The second is her inner demon, which she’s spent a lifetime fighting
to contain, because this personality is a murderous creature with no
moral compass. The demon is more or less her Id, an emotional creature
with no self-control.</p>
<p>The one time the demon gained full control of their body, she
transformed into a humanoid cat monster absolutely brimming with muscle,
which is more or less the demonic form of Artemis.</p>
<p>In that battle, the demon also publicly declared its name: The Eighth
Deadly Sin, Willful Insanity. She goes by Insanity, for short.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, Insanity was born the day Reggie Stewart was killed,
because Artemis completely lost control of herself, only coming to her
senses after the mixed group of demons and humans was defeated, with the
humans fleeing, while the demons were…extremely dead, with evidence of
claws and teeth.</p>
<p>Reggie witnessed the incident before he died and spoke as if he was
impressed, but Artemis has no memory of it.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, Insanity has a fondness for Jake, their father.</p>
<p>Insanity and the Hunter have a rather unusual relationship, in that
they hate and love each other, but neither of them would have it any
other way. When they face outside threats to their mind, lie telepathic
attacks, they usually face them together, despite the way Insanity
insists she’ll someday eat the Hunter.</p>
<p>What it comes down to is a matter of predator and prey dynamics, in
which Insanity has claimed the Hunter as prey, so Insanity refuses to
let anyone else kill her.</p>

<p>During the climax of book four, Artemis was splashed with
approximately an entire pint of LSD, which resulted in the emergence of
a third personality, who calls herself Alice, due to a song that was
playing at the time (<em>White Rabbit</em>, by Jefferson Airplane). Due
to how confused she was at the time, she took on an approximation of the
appearance of Alice from <em>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</em>,
blond hair and all.</p>
<p>Alice cares for the Hunter like a sister and has demonstrated a
tendency to side with her against Insanity, helping to keep the demon
under control.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p>Quite aside from this, Artemis occasionally hallucinates that she has
blood on her hands, because she was there when Reggie died and got blood
all over them, which is why she wears gloves. This hallucination got
worse in 1972, when her gloves got splashed with blood.</p>
<p>When Artemis gets tremendously angry, beyond merely losing her
temper, her eyes glow. This is part of her demonic ancestry, though it
is exceptionally rare.</p>
<h2 id="travels">Travels</h2>
<p>Artemis hates to travel, because she gets extremely motion sick in
vehicles. However, she has visited a number of places, both in and out
of the United States, including White Sands and Carlsbad Cavern, both in
New Mexico, The Cauldron of the Elements (a remote volcanic caldera
somewhere in the United States, which once hosted a summer camp),
California, Kansas, Canada, The Amazon, Egypt, the bottom of the Mariana
trench, Mount Everest, Vietnam, Tokyo in Japan, Alice Springs in
Australia, a snowy mountainside that may have been in Tibet, the Moon,
and a pocket dimension known as The Last Sanctuary.</p>

<p>Here’s a nice image of Artemis during her brief visit to Tokyo, while
her team was taking a break from fighting the demons hiding in the
jungles of Vietnam. On this occasion, her magic clothes went native
without her giving it much thought.</p>

<p>In 1986, she went undercover at a summer camp that was infested with
demons. At the time, she was pretending to be a teenager, despite the
fact she was old enough to be the grandmother of the teens that
surrounded her. She got particularly cranky while she was there, because
she doesn’t like to interact with teenagers.</p>

<h1 id="marta-blackwell">Marta Blackwell</h1>
<p>Marta Blackwell is the sister of <a
href="https://owentyme.us/characters/book-of-newts/amelia-blackwell.html">Amelia Blackwell</a>.</p>
<p>She’s a tall woman, about six feet in height, with golden blond hair
that’s usually loose down her back. She’s Caucasian, with blue eyes.
She’s twelve years older than Amelia, making her about 45 years old in
the opening scene of <a
href="https://owentyme.us/characters/book-of-newts/../../books/book-of-newts/starwitch.html">Starwitch</a>. She’s
usually described as very womanly, despite having a build like a
lumberjack.</p>
<p>Marta is often depressed, due to the way her husband was murdered,
just a short time after they were married. Even many years later, she
prefers black clothing as an outward sign of mourning. Marta is often
helpful to others, though she can’t stay as calm as her sister, <a
href="https://owentyme.us/characters/book-of-newts/iris-blackwell.html">Iris</a>, during an emergency.</p>
<p>Marta enjoys assisting <a href="https://owentyme.us/characters/book-of-newts/amelia-blackwell.html">Amelia</a>
with her projects, often doing the heavy lifting for her.</p>
<p>It isn’t clearly stated, but Marta has enough skill with medicine to
serve effectively as a nurse, something she did in Dugaria, before she
and her sisters were drafted into the military.</p>
<p>She was raised as a total pacifist by her mother, a fact that caused
her significant stress and emotional strain during her time in the
Dugaria military, because she was forced to serve as an Artillery Witch,
burning men alive with her magic.</p>
<p>She has great talent for earth and fire magic.</p>
<p>When the sisters escaped their home moon, Marta discovered a talent
for ceramic art, which she combined with runic enchantments. Her art is
one of the big money-makers for the Blackwell sisters.</p>

<h1 id="iris-blackwell">Iris Blackwell</h1>
<p>Iris Blackwell is the sister of <a
href="https://owentyme.us/characters/book-of-newts/amelia-blackwell.html">Amelia Blackwell</a>.</p>
<p>She’s a woman of average height with ash blond hair that’s usually in
french braids. She’s Caucasian, with blue eyes. She’s five years older
than Amelia, making her about 28 years old in the opening scene of <a
href="https://owentyme.us/characters/book-of-newts/../../books/book-of-newts/starwitch.html">Starwitch</a>. She’s
usually described as exceptionally beautiful.</p>
<p>In general, she’s quiet and a little somber, due to the way her
fiance was murdered, just a short time after they announced their
engagement to their village.</p>
<p>Iris is often helpful to others, with a tendency to remain calm, even
during an emergency, a fact that’s quite helpful in a variety of
situations.</p>
<p>She has excellent medical skills, comparable to a modern doctor, but
with magic, she can do far more. Her ability to remain focused during an
emergency allows her to skillfully manage a triage situation.</p>
<p>She’s also a skilled alchemist, with a focus on healing potions.</p>
<p>She was raised as a total pacifist by her mother, but over the course
of the first novel, she begins to embrace a more practical philosophy of
using violence only for self-defense and the greater good.</p>
<p>Though she’s normally quiet and reserved, she has a great loves for
fast vehicles and a tendency to drive or pilot like a madwoman. When
she’s at the controls of a vehicle (or anticipating such), her eyes
light up in an unsettling fashion.</p>
<p>Her specialties with magic include sensory, communication and spirit
magic, though during the first volume, she subconsciously refused to
allow herself to excel at spirit magic, because it’s one of the three
cornerstones of necromancy, which she was taught to fear and abhor.</p>
<p>As a result of this thinking, she subconsciously combined her talent
with spirit magic with her scrying/remote-viewing spells, giving her a
strange talent to hear, smell and touch things at the target location,
by generating an artificial spirit at the target location. Much to the
surprise of everyone, especially herself, she can use this artificial
spirit to manipulate objects. This nature of her strange talent isn’t
explained until volume two, when she meets a witch that specializes in
spirit magic.</p>
<p>Before she was drafted into the Witch Intelligence Agency (WIA) of
Dugaria, Iris worked in a hospital, as a doctor and healer.</p>

<h1 id="amelia-blackwell">Amelia Blackwell</h1>
<p>Amelia Blackwell is the primary protagonist in the series <a
href="https://owentyme.us/characters/book-of-newts/../../books/book-of-newts/index.html">The Book of Newts</a>. She’s
the owner of the magic book that gives the series its name.</p>
<p>She’s a small woman with dirty blond hair that ranges from short to
mid-back, depending on events of the story. She’s Caucasian, with blue
eyes. During the opening scene of <a
href="https://owentyme.us/characters/book-of-newts/../../books/book-of-newts/starwitch.html">Starwitch</a>, she’s
about 23 years old.</p>
<p>In general, she’s friendly and helpful to others. It’s extremely rare
for her to not think of others before herself, a habit ingrained into
her during her childhood, by her mother, Erkia Blackwell.</p>
<p>She was raised as a total pacifist by her mother, but over the course
of the first novel, she begins to embrace a more practical philosophy of
using violence only for self-defense and the greater good.</p>
<p>She’s a engineer, with a deep love for building machines of all sorts
and tends to get particularly excited about her projects.</p>
<p>She has a fondness for designing, building and modifying vehicles,
including horseless carriages, a pair of fixed wing airplanes she named
<em>Blackbird</em> and <em>Blackbird II</em>, an airship named
<em>Airwitch</em> and last, but not least, a rocket-style star ship
named <em>Starwitch</em>.</p>
<p>She occasionally dabbles in designing custom weaponry. She also
continually experiments with making new tools of her own design.</p>
<p>Despite the fact she’s clearly a genius, with an incredible mind for
numbers, she’s fairly humble about it, at least until someone tries to
throw legal hurdles in her way. At that point, her habit of voraciously
reading everything she can get her hands on becomes rather terrifying,
because she has a sharp enough intellect to confidently argue about the
law, usually to the detriment of those trying to use it as a hammer to
beat her down.</p>
<p>Amelia is also witch, but her magic powers are extremely weak.
However, she makes up for that by wielding magic with extreme precision.
For example, her range with scrying spells is rather pathetic, reaching
only inches away, but when employing such spells, she can see
microscopic detail.</p>
<p>One of Amelia’s favorite areas of study is enchanting, which allows
her to combine machines with magic, via runes. Her first big success in
this area was a steam engine that used runes to heat water, rather than
a firebox, which made the engine far more compact.</p>
<p>During her time in the militant nation of Dugaria, she was drafted
into the military and forced to become a military contractor, given the
job of developing a war wagon for the King. Instead, Amelia secretly
built <em>Starwitch</em> as the means for her family to escape their
forced military service.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="ashen-blades">Ashen Blades</h1>
<p>This series centers around the life of a half-demon girl that calls
herself the Hunter, whose parents were murdered by demons. Joining her
crusade against demon-kind are the Ashen Blades, also known as the Order
of Ash and Smoke, an organization of demon hunters.</p>
<p>The Hunter starts out with demon powers only, but eventually learns
that she’s also a witch, because her mother was a witch before she
became a demon. In <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-goes-to-war">She Goes to War</a>, she
gains an unwanted connection to an elemental spirit that draws in others
like it, starting a secondary war she doesn’t want, just so she can
retain her sanity (such as it is) and humanity.</p>
<p>She’s effectively mute, cursed by her nemesis to only be able to say,
“It’s a secret.” Therefore, she expresses herself in very physical ways
and has a fondness for offensive gestures.</p>
<p>She’s also beyond tenacious and absolutely never gives up, to the
point of bordering on or fully crossing into the realm of insanity. In
truth, the psychological makeup of a half-demon isn’t particularly
stable and later works reveal that she effectively has two
personalities, one representing her witch side, while the other
represents her demonic heritage. Fortunately for the world, her human
side is normally the one in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>The series starts out in 1940’s New York City, but decades pass
between each story, because the Hunter has the unlimited lifespan of a
demon and the series doesn’t stay in New York, though the Hunter is a
New Yorker to her core.</p>

Ashen Blades is <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/she-hunts-demons.html">She Hunts
Demons</a>.</p>
<p>It follows the misadventures of the Hunter and her private detective
partner, Clayton Simmons, as they investigate a murder and a string of
financial crimes brought to their attention by a demon pretending to be
a crying widow.</p>
<p>Little do they know, but Otto Vogerath, the very same demon that
murdered the Hunter’s parents, had the evidence hand-delivered to them.
They fall right into his web of lies and his grand game that’s played
with all of humanity at stake.</p>
<p>Along the way, the Hunter finally realizes the truth of her own past
and comes to recognize Vogerath as her arch-nemesis, giving her personal
crusade a focus, with a face and name.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for her, Vogerath has plans of his own and claims to
have arranged for the Hunter’s birth, because he needs the power of a
half-demon to fulfill his nefarious plans.</p>

Ashen Blades is <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/she-goes-to-war.html">She Goes to War</a>, in
which the Hunter feels drawn to Vietnam, in 1972, certain her nemesis
has returned to Earth.</p>
<p>What follows is a wild ride through a war zone as she tracks Vogerath
down, magically tugged in a particular direction, but just as everyone
else that fought in the war experienced, nothing goes according to plan
and the moment she touches down in the jungle, her animal instincts take
over, because the Spirit of the Jungle itself takes offense at her mere
presence.</p>
<p>Her own team, led by her partner, Clayton Simmons, are forced to
track her down and knock some sense into her.</p>
<p>The Hunter doesn’t know it, but Vogerath summoned her to Vietnam with
the intent of using her to weaken his master, all so he can be free of
the demonic pact of slavery he’s been stuck with since the previous
book.</p>

President!</a>, in which is Vogerath returns to Earth with a new power
to charm just about anyone that senses him, so long as they’re willing
to at least listen.</p>

as a Republican and then also as a Democrat, using his demonic power to
be in many places at once to convince the American public he’s a pair of

but for every body they get rid of, he has many more hidden away.</p>
<p>The public are soon eating out of his hand and willing to believe

<p><span class="book-cover"><img

once a symbol of wealth and status, but the arch-demon, Gluttony, has
slimmed down to embrace the modern world and what finer way to corrupt
the rich than with over-spending, wasteful consumption, illegal waste
dumping and willful ignorance of the way their actions affect the rest
of the world?</p>
<p>And what better tool could a demon in a corporate shark’s skin use
than massive mega-corporations that have no conscience and would sell
their soul to make a buck? Business is bigger than ever and Gluttony is
right at the center of it all, with a plan for every occasion and an
entire network of shell companies to shuffle the blame around, until it
can be dropped on someone innocent.</p>
<p>However, there’s one little hitch in her plans to corrupt the
business world: the Ashen Blades have just been tipped off about what
she’s doing and the Hunter is coming for her.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter stop Gluttony from consuming the business world from
the inside or will Gluttony succeed in corrupting and dirtying the hands
of the largest corporations in the world?</p>

<p><span class="book-cover"><img

<p>In the near future, a technological revolution begins as the first
true artificial intelligence is born – or so it seems. The real truth is
that the software in question is possessed by a rare variety of
tech-savvy demon known as a gremlin!</p>
<p>The human race mistakes the gremlins for helpful AIs designed to make
the lives of everyone better, in the form of intelligent software agents
given away by the company that supposedly invented them. They’re soon
installed on more than half the devices in the world, especially
smartphones.</p>
<p>The Ashen Blades soon discover the truth, that the arch-demon Greed
is behind the plot and the Hunter is forced to wreck every digital
device she sees, because they’re all out to get her!</p>
<p>Even worse, the gremlin-possessed devices work to establish a
massive, but invisible magical circle on the internet, which can only be
seen digitally, all as part of their preparation to open a portal to
Hell.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter find the means to fight the digital demons or will
she become just another of their victims?</p>

<h2 id="she-hunts-witches">She Hunts Witches</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/Cover-SheHuntsWitches.jpg" /></span> When a powerful
demon-witch appears in Japan, the Hunter begins a search-and-destroy
mission that crosses through famous cities in the Land of the Rising
Sun, while Verda Bagley and Lara Simmons back her up.</p>
<p>The plot of <em>She Hunts Witches</em> will revolve around the plans
of a minor villain from <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-hunts-demons">She Hunts Demons</a>
as she teams up with the blood witch from <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#demon-for-president">Demon for President!</a>. Together, they’re
largely after revenge on the Hunter and her friends.</p>
<p><em>She Hunts Witches</em> is a book I haven’t yet made up my mind
about. It’s only a potential novel, because I have no direct experience
with a visit to Japan. To get the descriptive details right, I would
either have to spend a great deal of time interviewing someone that has
or would have to take a research trip there. Unfortunately, I don’t have
the money for a trip like that.</p>
<p>I’m reluctant to do so, but I may have to change the location of this
novel.</p>
<p>This one is likely to be set eight years down the line from <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>, because I want Lara’s son,
James, to be about ten years old. I’d like him to become a hostage of
the demon witches. Being rescued by the Hunter will leave James thinking
the she’s the best thing since sliced bread.</p>

in the year 2502 A.D., offering their cousins on Earth the chance to
colonize space, the Hunter stows away on one of the colony ships, in
pursuit of a demon that seeks to spoil a new Garden of Eden, before it’s
even constructed.</p>
<p>The arch-demon Sloth seeks to forcefully implant demons in the
sleeping mind of every colonist during the decades long voyage between
stars, to produce an entire colony of demons.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter stop Sloth or will the demons gain a significant

<p><span class="book-cover"><img

illegal level of intelligence, comparable to that of a human, a robot
seeks to hide and survive on the streets of Neo York City on the planet
Neo York, deep within United Nations of the South Galaxy territory.</p>
<p>While on the run, it stumbles across a plot to develop a dangerous,
new weapon: a hand-held anti-matter explosive. Acting on a deep, moral
imperative, the robot decides to do something about it.</p>
<p>However, the robot isn’t the only one on the trail, stumbling into
the Hunter, who’s out to kill the demon-scientist developing the bomb
for the purpose of opening a portal to the home of demon-kind. Will they
team up or tear each other apart?</p>
<p>This novel will be set about 300 years before the time of Zechariah

<h2 id="short-stories">Short Stories</h2>
<p>I have plans for some short stories involving the Hunter and/or the
Ashen Blades. Each of these is likely to be paired with a novel and
added to the end, to fill them out, at least if one of them runs short,
like <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-goes-to-war">She Goes to War</a> did. It’s equally
likely these could end up as a collection of short stories that go
between two of the novels, though it’s possible some of them may become
flashbacks to earlier times.</p>
<p>While these stories are unlikely to move the overall plot of the
series, they should still be good fun.</p>
<h3 id="the-new-recruit">The New Recruit</h3>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>In this short story, Detective Shime Yasu, a New York City cop, grows
bored with the mundane, everyday drudgery of life and decides to take
the Ashen Blades up on their offer of membership and training.</p>
<p>She locates the card she was given, calls the number and makes
contact. She’s assigned Lara Simmons as her trainer and that necessarily
also involves the Hunter lending a hand, since the two of them are
partners.</p>
<p>On the first day of training, it turns out that every one of the
trainees brought weapons from home, based on superstition and
misconception, including the detective.</p>
<p>To disabuse the trainees of their incorrect notions, the Hunter
captures the infamous squirrel-demon, Ulmoch, and every one of the
strange and amusing items the trainees brought is tested on him, to
demonstrates what does and doesn’t work.</p>
<p>This has to take place after <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks
Peace</a>, since it’s based on the detective from <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#demon-for-president">Demon for President!</a> and there was no
time skip between those two novels.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h3 id="she-makes-movies">She Makes Movies</h3>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/Cover-SheMakesMovies.jpg" /></span>This short story
begins with the Hunter insisting that Lara take her to a movie and Lara
reluctantly obliges. Lara is startled to see a movie poster on the wall
with her partner’s face on it! They sit down to watch and it turns out
the Hunter is in the starring role of the movie, the very reason she
insisted on going!</p>
<p>As they settle in to watch, a flashback begins, in which the Hunter
sniffs out the trail of a demon in Hollywood, California. She’s mistaken
for a minor actress in the film and handed a superhero costume, which
allows her to skulk around in the background of the movie sets.</p>
<p>This one will likely also take place after <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>, because I want the Hunter
to have the ability to fly in this one.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h3 id="demon-blood-she-goes-to-school">Demon Blood: She Goes to
School</h3>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>The Hunter is once again forced to confront the most perilous of all
trials: teenagers.</p>
<p>James Simmons, the son of Lara and Clayton Simmons, has been seeing
and smelling strange things in school and a series of kids have gone
missing during school hours, over the course of years. As a personal
favor to Lara, the Hunter goes undercover as a teenager, in search of
the demon hiding among the students.</p>
<p>Like the frog demons from summer camp, this particular demon is
extremely difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Hunter has been avoiding James, mostly because
he’s infatuated with her and she isn’t interested, but since Lara wants
her son to be safe, the Hunter shares his class schedule and he follows
her like an unwanted puppy.</p>
<p>At some point in this story, James will be badly injured and need a
transfusion. The only person available with a compatible blood type will
be the Hunter. Her half-demon blood will inadvertently activate dormant
fairy powers even Lara had no idea her son possessed, on top of giving
him access to demon magic.</p>
<p>The time frame for this one will be about thirteen years after <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>.</p>
<p>It’s just possible this one will become a full-blown novel of its
own, since I fully intend to spin off a series about James. The series
is likely to be titled <em>Demon Blood</em>.</p>
<h3 id="she-hunts-strangers">She Hunts Strangers</h3>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>This short story will be set after the events of <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#smart-bomb">Smart Bomb</a>. It will take place during the same
time frame as <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../wizards-scion/forgotten-legends.html">Forgotten Legends</a>.
She may or may not have the robot from that book as her partner in this
story, depending on the result of their conflict.</p>
<p>The Hunter notices the disappearance of children from the streets of
Neo York City and begins an independent investigation, despite
constantly running-afoul of local police, who are following much the
same leads.</p>
<p>Unlike the police, however, she suspects something supernatural is
happening and she’s not wrong, though it isn’t the demons she suspected.
She soon uncovers the existence of the Strangers, a type of creature
born from the beliefs of children, because small children don’t really
believe a human would ever kidnap someone. The Strangers are born from
their childish beliefs that it must be a monster.</p>
<p>She begins a crusade to end the Stranger threat by violence, because
she’s always considered it her highest duty to protect innocent children
and she’s (eventually) joined by a pair of police detectives that
realize they’re totally out of their depth.</p>
<p>Will they end the Strangers, or will the child-eating monsters slip
though their fingers?</p>
