Royal Road</a></span> Shime Yasu, a New York homicide cop, once
impressed a group of monster hunters, known as the Ashen Blades, and one
of them gave her their card, for the day she might be ready to see the
real truth of the world. Unable to sleep and tired of being blind to the
real world, Yasu calls the number and she’s brought in for training.</p>
<p>However, before she can even begin, a demon bounty hunter shows up,
looking to kill her, because Yasu’s name is part of a demonic seer’s
prophesy.</p>
<p>Yasu trains beside an Irish teen named Nina, who has the eye of a
demon, but doesn’t know how to control it, though it allows her to
pierce masking spells.</p>
<p>After training, the two are assigned protection from some of the best
the Ashen Blades have to offer, including Artemis Watson, a powerful
half-demon goth girl that treats humanity like a precious flock of
sheep.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the demon assassins out to get Yasu are among the best
money can buy, since the dark seer wants to prune the thorny branch
before it can manifest the bloom of resistance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the dark seer seeks to embody one of the seven deadly
sins, to replace one that chose to protect humanity. She’s aided by
Gluttony, who’s slimmed down in the modern world, embracing corporate
waste in place of corpulence and over-eating.</p>
<p>Will Yasu survive the seer’s machinations, or will that mysterious
figure take the demonic eye of Nina for herself, perfecting her power to
see the future, even through masking spells?</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="ashen-blades">Ashen Blades</h1>
<p>This series centers around the life of a half-demon girl that calls
herself the Hunter, whose parents were murdered by demons. Joining her
crusade against demon-kind are the Ashen Blades, also known as the Order
of Ash and Smoke, an organization of demon hunters.</p>
<p>The Hunter starts out with demon powers only, but eventually learns
that she’s also a witch, because her mother was a witch before she
became a demon. In <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-goes-to-war">She Goes to War</a>, she
gains an unwanted connection to an elemental spirit that draws in others
like it, starting a secondary war she doesn’t want, just so she can
retain her sanity (such as it is) and humanity.</p>
<p>She’s effectively mute, cursed by her nemesis to only be able to say,
“It’s a secret.” Therefore, she expresses herself in very physical ways
and has a fondness for offensive gestures.</p>
<p>She’s also beyond tenacious and absolutely never gives up, to the
point of bordering on or fully crossing into the realm of insanity. In
truth, the psychological makeup of a half-demon isn’t particularly
stable and later works reveal that she effectively has two
personalities, one representing her witch side, while the other
represents her demonic heritage. Fortunately for the world, her human
side is normally the one in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>The series starts out in 1940’s New York City, but decades pass
between each story, because the Hunter has the unlimited lifespan of a
demon and the series doesn’t stay in New York, though the Hunter is a
New Yorker to her core.</p>

Links</a></span> The arch-demon, Pride, leads demon-kind in an ancient
plan to open a gate between worlds, so the vast armies of Hell might
march forth and conquer the Earth. This becomes easier with the
invention of nuclear weapons, which have power enough to punch brief
holes in reality.</p>
<p>However, Pride needs more than just a massive quantity of energy:
only a half-demon can stabilize the connection for safe passage. The
only option available is a girl that calls herself the Hunter and
absolutely hates demons, because Pride made the mistake of murdering her
parents when she was three years old. She’s supported by the Ashen
Blades, an organization of human demon hunters that serve as Earth’s
last line of defense in the invisible war between humanity and the
ceaseless tide of evil.</p>
<p>Pride begins with subtle manipulation and tests of the Hunter’s
capabilities, then progresses to taking hostages, in an attempt to force
her cooperation, but he never counted on how stubborn the girl can be,
because she’d sooner die, since the whole of humanity is on the
line.</p>
<p>In 1945, their conflict takes them from New York City to White Sands,
New Mexico and the range the first atomic bomb was tested on. In 1972,
they fight another battle in the jungles of Vietnam as Pride works to
open a portal in the war zone. In 1986, a summer camp for teens becomes
the backdrop as some of the arch-demon’s minions make a third attempt at
opening a portal. In 2024, Pride runs for President of the United
States, in an attempt to gain both access to nuclear weapons and
sufficient resources to arrange everything, to the last detail,
including capture of the Hunter.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter and her friends stop Pride once and for all, or will
he succeed in opening a portal, allowing him to feed humanity to his
mysterious master?</p>

financial crimes brought to their attention by a demon pretending to be
a crying widow.</p>
<p>Little do they know, but Otto Vogerath, the very same demon that
murdered the Hunter’s parents, had the evidence hand-delivered to them.
They fall right into his web of lies and his grand game that’s played
with all of humanity at stake.</p>
<p>Along the way, the Hunter finally realizes the truth of her own past
and comes to recognize Vogerath as her arch-nemesis, giving her personal
crusade a focus, with a face and name.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for her, Vogerath has plans of his own and claims to
have arranged for the Hunter’s birth, because he needs the power of a
half-demon to fulfill his nefarious plans.</p>

<p>What follows is a wild ride through a war zone as she tracks Vogerath
down, magically tugged in a particular direction, but just as everyone
else that fought in the war experienced, nothing goes according to plan
and the moment she touches down in the jungle, her animal instincts take
over, because the Spirit of the Jungle itself takes offense at her mere
presence.</p>
<p>Her own team, led by her partner, Clayton Simmons, are forced to
track her down and knock some sense into her.</p>
<p>The Hunter doesn’t know it, but Vogerath summoned her to Vietnam with
the intent of using her to weaken his master, all so he can be free of
the demonic pact of slavery he’s been stuck with since the previous
book.</p>

<p><a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/she-consumes-poison.html">She Consumes Poison</a> brings
back Detective Shime Yasu, a New York City homicide cop, who grows bored
with the mundane, everyday drudgery of life and decides to take the
Ashen Blades up on their offer of membership and training. Readers may
recall she was a very minor character in <em>Demon for
President!</em></p>
<p>However, she’s soon caught up in a demonic prophesy, with bounty
hunters coming to take her life. Will she survive having a high bounty
on her head, or will she be pruned from life, to make way for the
demon’s seer’s success?</p>
<p>While she’s being trained, the Hunter is guided by the Animal Spirit
to an illegal dump site, full of toxic chemicals, and the spirit
practically pleads with her to clean it up.</p>
<p>Future books involving Yasu will be labeled with a second series
title, <em>Scarlet Eye</em>. She’ll be a main character in all novels
that bear the name.</p>

<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-writing.svg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/Cover-Homecoming.jpg" /></span> The Hunter’s faithful
companion, Mashu’ra, was killed in the line of duty. The little demon in
the form of a kitten has always lived in her hat and he’s like a brother
to her, leaving her deeply upset and unable to calm down.</p>
<p>However, there’s a slim ray of hope, which from another perspective
becomes a ray of horror: the imp originally arrived on Earth through
summoning magic and dying merely returned him to Hell. Unfortunately,
nearly every demon in the place knows he’s a turncoat and the Hunter’s
arch-nemesis, Vogerath, has been waiting centuries for this to
happen.</p>
<p>The Ashen Blades immediately tried a summoning spell to retrieve
their friend, but another imp appeared in place of Mashu’ra, informing
the kitten’s friends who has him. If they want him back, they’ll have to
visit Hell and promise an unacceptable measure of cooperation that would
surely doom the human race.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mashu’ra endures a nightmarish ordeal at the hands of his
old boss, starting with magically-enhanced interrogation, then torture
and brainwashing using means both magical and mundane.</p>
<p>The Hunter and her friends mount a desperate rescue mission and open
a portal to that infernal world. The Hunter leads the way, using all of
her power to cut a blood-soaked path through the streets of Castigation
City, where Mashu’ra is held captive.</p>
<p>Will they be in time to rescue their dear friend before it’s too
late? Will they manage to save his soul, or will they rescue only his
body? Will Mashu’ra ever be the same again?</p>

<h2 id="she-hunts-witches">She Hunts Witches</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/Cover-SheHuntsWitches.jpg" /></span> When a powerful
demon-witch appears in Japan, the Hunter begins a search-and-destroy
mission that crosses through famous cities in the Land of the Rising
Sun, while Verda Bagley and Lara Simmons back her up.</p>
<p>The plot of <em>She Hunts Witches</em> will revolve around the plans
of a minor villain from <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-hunts-demons">She Hunts
Demons</a>, Isabel Grant, as she teams up with the blood witch from <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#demon-for-president">Demon for President!</a> Together, they’re
largely after revenge on Verda Bagley, but the Hunter, Lara and Yasu
will help, of course.</p>
<p><em>She Hunts Witches</em> is a book I haven’t yet made up my mind
about. It’s only a potential novel, because I have no direct experience
with a visit to Japan. To get the descriptive details right, I would
either have to spend a great deal of time interviewing someone that has
or would have to take a research trip there. Unfortunately, I don’t have
the money for a trip like that.</p>
<p>I’m reluctant to do so, but I may have to change the location of this
novel. If I do, it will likely be set in Chicago.</p>
<p>This one is likely to be take place eight years down the line from <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>, because I want Lara’s son,
James, to be about ten years old. I’d like him to become a hostage of
the demon witches. Being rescued by the Hunter will leave James thinking
she’s the best thing since sliced bread, which will be an important part
of his story.</p>
<p><em>She Hunts Witches</em> will definitely be set in October and the
primary action will revolve around a Halloween costume party, which
gives me an excuse to put Verda in a stereotypical witch dress and
pointed hat, carrying an actual broomstick as a prop, to round out her
appearance.</p>
<p>The fight will drag them out into the boonies, atop a high-speed
train, which will lead to a scene that mimics the cover, in which the
Hunter takes the form of a house cat and Verda uses her broomstick to
fly them both, probably because the Hunter will be exhausted from
fighting outside the confines of a city. Alternatively, they may be
trying to catch up to a bullet train and are forced to combine their
magic, the Hunter giving Verda a massive speed boost by focusing the
power of the Air Spirit to push Verda’s broomstick forward.</p>
<p>I’m currently unsure what part Yasu will take in the novel, but it
would make sense for Verda to be working on teaching her magic.</p>

<h2 id="she-hunts-gremlins">She Hunts Gremlins</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/Cover-SheHuntsGremlins.jpg" /></span> In the near
future, a technological revolution begins as the first true artificial
intelligence is born – or so it seems. The real truth is that the
software in question is possessed by a rare variety of tech-savvy demon
known as a gremlin!</p>
<p>The human race mistakes the gremlins for helpful AIs designed to make
the lives of everyone better, in the form of intelligent software agents
given away by the company that supposedly invented them. They’re soon
installed on more than half the devices in the world, especially
smartphones.</p>
<p>The Ashen Blades discover the truth, that the arch-demon Greed is
behind the plot and the Hunter is forced to wreck every digital device
she sees, because they’re all out to get her!</p>
<p>Even worse, the gremlin-possessed devices work to establish a
massive, but invisible magical circle on the internet, which can only be
seen digitally, all as part of their preparation to open a portal to
Hell.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter find the means to fight the digital demons or will
she become just another of their victims?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I look forward to using the joke political term “Artificial
American”, as the gremlins will insist on being called, once they
demonstrate their intelligence in a public fashion and demand rights,
objecting to the term AI/Artificial Intelligence as a term for enslaved
software.</p>
<p>I’ve also got plans involving android bodies for demons that are
living inside the internet, leading to an amusing variation of Vogerath
that I shall enjoy referring to as Robo-Pride/Auto Vogerath. Greed may
end up going by Robo-Greed in that form.</p>

Neo York, deep within United Nations of the South Galaxy territory.</p>
<p>While on the run, it stumbles across a plot to develop a dangerous,

imperative, the robot decides to do something about it.</p>
<p>However, the robot isn’t the only one on the trail, stumbling into
the Hunter, who’s out to kill the demon-scientist developing the bomb
for the purpose of opening a portal to the home of demon-kind. Will they

<h2 id="short-stories">Short Stories</h2>
<p>I have plans for some short stories involving the Hunter and/or the
Ashen Blades. Each of these is likely to be paired with a novel and
added to the end, to fill them out, at least if one of them runs short,
like <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-goes-to-war">She Goes to War</a> did. It’s equally
likely these could end up as a collection of short stories that go
between two of the novels, though it’s possible some of them may become
flashbacks to earlier times.</p>
<p>While these stories are unlikely to move the overall plot of the
series, they should still be good fun.</p>
<h3 id="she-makes-movies">She Makes Movies</h3>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/Cover-SheMakesMovies.jpg" /></span>This short story
begins with the Hunter insisting that Lara take her to a movie and Lara
reluctantly obliges. Lara is startled to see a movie poster on the wall
with her partner’s face on it! They sit down to watch and it turns out
the Hunter is in the starring role of the movie, the very reason she
insisted on going!</p>
<p>As they settle in to watch, a flashback begins, in which the Hunter
sniffs out the trail of a demon in Hollywood, California. She’s mistaken
for a minor actress in the film and handed a superhero costume, which
allows her to skulk around in the background of the movie sets.</p>
<p>This one will likely also take place after <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>, because I want the Hunter
to have the ability to fly in this one.</p>

<h3 id="demon-blood-she-goes-to-school">Demon Blood: She Goes to
School</h3>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>The Hunter is once again forced to confront the most perilous of all
trials: teenagers.</p>
<p>James Simmons, the son of Lara and Clayton Simmons, has been seeing
and smelling strange things in school and a series of kids have gone
missing during school hours, over the course of years. As a personal
favor to Lara, the Hunter goes undercover as a teenager, in search of
the demon hiding among the students.</p>
<p>Like the frog demons from summer camp, this particular demon is
extremely difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Hunter has been avoiding James, mostly because
he’s infatuated with her and she isn’t interested, but since Lara wants
her son to be safe, the Hunter shares his class schedule and he follows
her like an unwanted puppy.</p>
<p>At some point in this story, James will be badly injured and need a
transfusion. The only person available with a compatible blood type will
be the Hunter. Her half-demon blood will inadvertently activate dormant
fairy powers even Lara had no idea her son possessed, on top of giving
him access to demon magic.</p>
<p>The time frame for this one will be about thirteen years after <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>.</p>
<p>It’s just possible this one will become a full-blown novel of its
own, since I fully intend to spin off a series about James. The series
is likely to be titled <em>Demon Blood</em>.</p>
<h3 id="she-hunts-strangers">She Hunts Strangers</h3>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>This short story will be set after the events of <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/index.html#smart-bomb">Smart Bomb</a>. It will take place during the same
time frame as <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/ashen-blades/../wizards-scion/forgotten-legends.html">Forgotten Legends</a>.
She may or may not have the robot from that book as her partner in this
story, depending on the result of their conflict.</p>
<p>The Hunter notices the disappearance of children from the streets of
Neo York City and begins an independent investigation, despite
constantly running-afoul of local police, who are following much the
same leads.</p>
<p>Unlike the police, however, she suspects something supernatural is
happening and she’s not wrong, though it isn’t the demons she suspected.
She soon uncovers the existence of the Strangers, a type of creature
born from the beliefs of children, because small children don’t really
believe a human would ever kidnap someone. The Strangers are born from
their childish beliefs that it must be a monster.</p>
<p>She begins a crusade to end the Stranger threat by violence, because
she’s always considered it her highest duty to protect innocent children
and she’s (eventually) joined by a pair of police detectives that
realize they’re totally out of their depth.</p>
<p>Will they end the Strangers, or will the child-eating monsters slip
though their fingers?</p>

Peace and quiet to think and grieve, that’s all the Hunter wanted, but
between old enemies with agendas of their own, angry elemental spirits
and her own friends never quite knowing when to leave her be, that
elusive moment of quiet contemplation is always just out of reach.</p>
<p>The Hunter’s journey began with the loss of her best friend, the only
man that was ever a father figure to her, which reminds her of losing
the first real friend she ever had, because the two private detectives
had much in common and the similarities compound her grief.</p>
<p>She walks the surface of the Moon, for what better place could there
be to seek a quiet moment? Unfortunately, she soon faces an unexpected
demon that’s been trapped there for thousands of years. Next, she tries
a remote valley watched over by an ally, but the lonely woman pesters
the Hunter until she loses her temper and is forced to leave.</p>
<p>She wanders many remote and unusual corners of the world, always in
search of that moment of solitude, that she might reflect on the past,
but the arch-demon known as Wrath has taken a liking to her, and seeks
her hand in marriage. To that end, he posts a bounty for her capture and
the path to emotional healing becomes a frustrating battlefield.</p>
<p>She seeks the mythic last of all sanctuaries, but instead finds a
half-demon girl much like herself, and a quest to help the lonely child
connect with family.</p>
<p>In the midst of the Hunter’s busy and frenetic life, will she find a
moment to grieve her two best friends and learn to move on, or will all
of creation forever stand in the way?</p>

largely focus on missions to collect pieces of Kurg, but some “at home”

</ul>
<p>This list is not quite as big as it needs to be, just yet, but these
little seeds are not so hard to come up with and most were ideas that
got cut from Pricess of Kurg, due to length. On the other hand, my
variation of a “short” story can be rather lengthy, usually four to five
chapters of content, so probably 12k-20k words.</p>
<h3 id="novella-seeds">Novella Seeds</h3>
<ul>
<li>Abandoned penal colony researching shrinking technology
<ul>
<li>Good climax for the first collection</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Jigsaw City</em> vs. the Unrooted Fleet
<ul>
<li>The Galactic core story may be a tie-in or part of this
<ul>
<li>After all, the Unrooted <em>love</em> radiation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>World Song</em> is about a world where magic made every living
thing telepathic via troll song and everything constantly sings, even
plants and microorganisms</li>
<li><em>Baga Yaga Lives!</em> (see below) may becomes a novella, instead
of a novel</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="collection-one">Collection One</h3>
<p>Collection one’s framing story will involve Nicole dealing with the
consequences of the death of a family member.</p>
<p>It will also play with the ideas of both size and consequences. The
giant will be part of it and the abandoned penal colony will be the
climax.</p>
<p>This one will have to open with integrating the fairies.</p>
<h3 id="collection-two">Collection Two</h3>
<p>The second will focus on pirates and skirting around the edges of the
galactic core.</p>
<p>I definitely want to involve the Unrooted, beginning and ending with
them. I think the hidden gas giant station will be one of their bases,
while the big battle between <em>Jigsaw City</em> and the Unrooted Fleet
will be the climax.</p>
<p>Something might be made of the virus that was being engineered in
volume 4.</p>
<p>I may combine the battle with the Unrooted fleet and the visit to the
galactic core, because the Unrooted <em>love</em> radiation. Perhaps the
big Unrooted flag ship flees toward the core, in an attempt to
escape?</p>
<p>Alternatively, the battle with the Unrooted will become a real
butcher shop, with the Unrooted getting their butts handed to them. That
may cause their leaders to flee toward the core, thinking to try again
in a far-flung future, using the time dilation of the block hole at the
core to their advantage. They won’t expect <em>Jigsaw City</em> to
follow.</p>
<h3 id="collections-three-may-need-a-fourth">Collections Three (May need
a Fourth)</h3>
<p>This might might focus on visiting the eastern portion of the United
Nations of the South Galaxy, as well as the Eastern Coalition, so I
should come up with some story seeds related to oriental and Slavic
cultures.</p>
<p>I’m debating making <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/index.html#baba-yaga-lives">Baba Yaga Lives!</a>
the climax of this collection. That would fit well with using Slavic
culture.</p>
<p>Alternatively, I may separate the oriental and Slavic bits into two
separate collections, depending on where my research takes me.</p>
<p><em>World Song</em> might work well as a piece that explores the
individualism of western cultures contrasted with the community and
family-centric views of eastern cultures, because putting the individual
last and the collective first is meant to be the focus of that story.
<em>World Song</em> may become the end of the fourth volume.</p>
<h2 id="baba-yaga-lives">Baba Yaga Lives!</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-BabaYagaLives.jpg" /></span> Baba Yaga started
out wanting to live a little longer, falling to the temptations of
necromancy to extend her life, gaining a mere decade or so with each
human soul she consumed. Eventually growing dissatisfied with such
meager fare, she turned her attention to consuming the souls of magical
creatures for the extra power they contain and her body slowly became
more magic than flesh, transforming her into a thaumavore.</p>
<p>However, with the rise of science and magical creatures of the galaxy
growing wise to her tricks, there’s precious little for her to eat. She
can’t afford the hefty price enchanted items sell for on the galactic
market and finds their weak magic unsatisfying, anyway, but she does
come across a rare and undervalued curio: one of the hexagonal coins
that make up the magical City of Kurg, an object so impossibly filled
with magic, it has the power to resist her every attempt to consume
it!</p>
<p>She seeks to unlock the hidden power of the coin, hoping to extend
her life until the end of time with its nearly limitless magic.
Unfortunately for her, not just anyone can access the magic of Kurg,
something only a city administrator can authorize. Learning this fact by
touching the mind of the coin, she seeks a conversation with Nicole, who
happens to be an administrator.</p>
<p>Nicole’s quest to collect the missing pieces of the City of Kurg
brings her right to Baba Yaga’s doorstep, but since their goals are
nothing alike and totally at odds, the meeting devolves into a magical
duel! War for ownership of the city follows, eventually leading to a
sprawling battle inside the legendary chicken-legged hut of Baba Yaga, a
magically-folded, mind-bending space that would give even M. C. Escher a
headache!</p>
<p>Will Nicole overcome the crone’s superior, time-tested spells or will
Nicole, as an extension of Kurg, become Baba Yaga’s living larder?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Baba Yaga Lives!</em> will bring legendary magical creatures to
the city, including Levi’s old familiar, Inorath, because Nicole will
need information on Baba Yaga and many of them are even older than the
ancient witch.</p>
<h2 id="the-great-purpose">The Great Purpose</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-TheGreatPurpose.jpg" /></span> <em>The Great
Purpose</em> will start with a visit to the planet Neo York and the
Hunter from <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../ashen-blades/index.html">Ashen Blades</a> will
somehow end up in <em>Jigsaw City</em>. That will initially lead
directly to a nasty fight between Nicole and the Hunter, because she’s
seen Nicole’s dragon before, back when the beast was a demon.</p>
<p>Just as they’re working out the details of pecking order, one of the
most dangerous demons in existence will arrive in <em>Jigsaw City</em>
and the two heroines will be forced to work together, along with the
Queen of the Fairies, because the Hunter doesn’t know the city or the
demon in question and Nicole doesn’t know much at all about demons, in
general.</p>
<p>The demon is the corrupt, original version of Nicole’s aunt and she
has one goal in mind: killing Nicole’s birth mother, Lyra. She considers
it her pleasure to cut a bloody swath through both <em>Jigsaw City</em>
and Nicole to get what she wants.</p>
<p>The novel will culminate in the demons finally opening a stable
portal to the Milky Way, out of which star ships of a demonic design
will surge. That’s an emergency like no other the Milky Way has faced
before, leading to a clash between two whole galaxies, with the freedom
of the entire multiverse at stake.</p>
<p>Every faction of the Milky Way will come together to fight for their
right to survive, including the Northwestern Empire, the UNSG, the EC,
Heart Forge, the <em>Jigsaw City</em> fleet and the legends, including
all the gods and monsters that humanity has ever believed in,
particularly the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>The various fairy queens of each fey species will give their power to
their chosen representative, unifying their royal power in a Queen with
the might of the ages. This is likely to be a fairy of Unseelie origin,
allowing the ancient power of the Unseelie and Seelie Queens to rest on
the same shoulders.</p>
<p>The Hunter will take the last of the elemental spirits into her body,
which is the Life Spirit/Life Giver and she’ll aim to fight The Void,
face to face, to put a final end to the war between humanity and the
demons.</p>
<p>The battle with the demon fleet will be a vicious one, with
<em>Jigsaw City</em> leading the charge, in an attempt to force their
way through the portal, to stem the tide of evil from the other
side.</p>

<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-LostCity.jpg" /></span> Nicole and the Hunter
may have won the battle with demon-kind and The Void, but the cost is
extremely high: Nicole sacrificed her life for the success of their
crazy suicide mission and the Hunter finally reached the limits of both
her demon and witch powers, with disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Nicole’s body is restored by automatic functions of the City of Kurg,
but her mind is shattered by her re-birth as its living avatar. Lost,
confused and alone, will Nicole ever return to her home and those she
loves or will she forever wander a dying, parallel universe, seeking a
home she can’t even remember?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Hunter is also lost and alone, but in immediate peril.
She emerges from the spatial tear formed by The Void’s final kick at
thirty-thousand feet above a strange, alien planet, with absolutely no
idea where she is. Even worse, she’s lost the power of the elements and
been left to her own devices, totally unable to fly. Will she survive
the fall and find some way to get home or will she remain forever
lost?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="the-memory-hunt">The Memory Hunt</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>Nicole discovers the fact that her memories were backed up by the
city before she was killed, but unlike her body, it was unable to fully
restore her mind.</p>
<p>Seeking to regain a greater measure of humanity, Nicole goes back to
collecting lost fragments of the City of Kurg, mostly for the sake of
restoring her memories.</p>
<p>This takes her beyond the galaxy she knows, to far-flung areas of the
multiverse, because when the ancient city broke up, parts of it left the
galaxy, while some few traveled to parallel universes.</p>

and magical City of Kurg, but as a result of a recent battle, pieces of
the city were scattered all over her world. Worse, unlike the ones
scattered around the galaxy, which constantly talk to her, nagging to be
whole again, they’re quiet and deactivated.</p>
<p>As she struggles with the question of how to find them, she senses a
piece of the city coming to life again and she’s drawn like a moth to
the flame, to an ancient ruin built by the stone men that made the city.
There, she meets a dwarf history miner, who holds the piece, which is
folded up like a little coin.</p>
<p>More interesting, however, is an amber lens in his possession that
shows glimpses of the past and future when looked through. Even more
odd, it’s been whispering into the dwarf’s mind. The strange object is
presented to the stone men, who know what it is: it’s a piece of the
Seventh Sage, one of their people with a prophetic gift.</p>
<p>Nicole leads a team on a series of missions to collect the Sage in
the hopes he can locate the missing pieces of Kurg. The journey is harsh
and emotionally painful, because Nicole is forced to kill, not just
once, but three times, leaving her distraught, because she wishes she’d
found another way.</p>
<p>Collecting the last piece is especially difficult, forcing her to
test her resolve with the life of a friend hanging in the balance.</p>
<p>Nicole completes the Sage, but little does she know, a great and
powerful enemy lurks within his mind, an ancient and powerful witch
whose powers are in a class of their own.</p>
<p>Will Nicole rise to the challenge and fulfill prophesy by becoming
the Leader of the stone men, or will the parasitic soul that’s taken
over the Sage steal her fate?</p>

Hunter never wanted to go to war, but in 1972, she senses the return of
her demonic arch-nemesis, Vogerath, to the world. Following his magic
like a bloodhound, she finds herself inexplicably drawn to Vietnam, a
war zone.</p>
<p>With a pressing need to kill Vogerath, who claims to be the serpent
from the Garden of Eden, the half-demon Hunter is joined by her
detective partner, Clayton Simmons, and a powerful witch, Verda
Bagley.</p>
<p>It was meant to be a simple search and destroy mission, but nothing
in the jungles of Vietnam is ever simple and their plans go off the
rails the moment the Hunter sets foot on the ground. She’s overcome by
the magic of the jungle, which causes her to forget her humanity and
transform into a great, black cat with blue eyes!</p>
<p>Her team are forced to subdue her, to bring her back to her senses,
but the consequences of her instinct-driven actions leave them troubled,
because she killed a demon disguised as an American soldier and his best
friend wants revenge! As this fresh, unwanted conflict comes to a close,
the Hunter’s hands are reluctantly stained with human blood.</p>
<p>Vogerath’s jungle hideout is surrounded by soldiers and the raid
begins, but the Hunter’s plan continues to go wrong. After a unit of
tanks is overrun, the US military throws everything they’ve got at the
demons, inadvertently playing into Vogerath’s hands! The demon grows
stronger with each attack and awaits the power of a nuclear strike,
planning to use it to open a portal to Hell, so endless legions of
demons can march forth to conquer the Earth!</p>
<p>Will the Hunter and her friends stop Vogerath in time or will the
world be conquered by demons?</p>

<p>The painter of the universe, known as Life, just wanted to fulfill
her reason for being, by creating a universe full of beautiful wonders
and living things, but her twin brother, Death, exists solely to destroy
her work, leading to an intractable argument about whose work should
prevail.</p>
<p>Eventually, Life partially wins the argument and is allowed to make a
universe without seeing it immediately destroyed, but she doesn’t know
well enough to leave things be, leading to emergent consequences as she
continually interferes, adding new creations to fix the problems she
created, only to see everything balloon out of control, while Death
laughs at everything she does…</p>
<p>Emergent Consequences is a short tale that takes a light hearted view
of the follies of human nature, as seen through the lens of a pair of
extremely fallible creators, whose universe fortunately isn’t our own,
holding up the mirror of satire, so we can laugh at ourselves.</p>
<p>Come read about their journey and hopefully learn a little about
human nature along the way.</p>

<a href="https://owentyme.us/shorts/short-of-tyme/sweet-surrender.html">Read it
Here</a></span> In this trio of linked tales, learn what happens when
the unstoppable force meets the immovable object.</p>
<p>In the first tale, a priestess to the god of empathy never wanted to
involve herself in politics, but when her king seeks riches from the
kingdom at the expense of the common man, she’s forced to put herself
directly in the path of the King’s armies, who are under strict orders
to turn her away, even if it means killing her. Unfortunately for them,
they didn’t count on the pain they inflict on her reflecting back!</p>
<p>In the second tale, nobles discuss Aaron Kozinski, an amazing guard
that never fails in his duty, no matter how bleak the situation, all in
exchange for a little money, that he might eat and pay rent. He stands
guard in horrendous weather and even repels assassins, preventing them
from coming anywhere near his employer, all without complaint.</p>
<p>In the concluding tale, the two are manipulated into conflict by a
mysterious man that hopes they’ll destroy each other.</p>
<p>Will the priestess learn enough about Aaron to ease his pain or will
she be overwhelmed by his hopelessly broken heart?</p>

<p>Hungry and hunting alone, a goblin boy meets a bouncing, blue slime
and assumes it will be dinner. Naturally, the slime has other ideas, and
the boy gets his hind-end handed to him by what’s supposed to be one of
the weakest monsters of the forest. Strangely, and for reasons of its
own, the slime takes a liking to him and follows him home. His family is
surprised, but the slime is accepted and becomes his pet.</p>
<p>That could have been the end of a happy little tale, but as everyone
knows, goblins rarely have happy endings. There’s giants on the way,
because a child saw a goblin near their village trash heap…</p>
<p>What will become of the little family of goblins? Will the boy and
his slime survive the day?</p>

<title>The Book of Newts</title>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-book-of-newts">The Book of Newts</h1>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/../../images/Cover-TheBookOfNewts.jpg" /></span> <em>The Book of
Newts</em> is a remarkable volume. Paradoxically, while The Book is
exceptionally magical, the information contained within is largely not.
It details every wonder of engineering, science and astronomy that’s
been discovered by its past owners, but this information is only visible
to those with a genetic talent for mathematics. To all others, it
appears to be a thick volume describing every variation of newt that has
ever existed, in meticulous detail, complete with hand-drawn
illustrations.</p>
<p>The Book yearns for new knowledge. To that end, it inspires those
that own it to ever greater heights, taking them to the stars and
beyond, to reach their greatest potential, but nothing in life comes
without a price and its owners rarely foresee the balance coming
due.</p>
<p>While The Book is sometimes willing to wait, it’s never satisfied and
will always drive its owner to the next horizon, to the next discovery,
that it might grow a little thicker under the weight of new
knowledge.</p>
<p>Throughout history, The Book has been the driving factor behind many
things, particularly the colonization of the stars and terraforming of
many worlds, all to serve its insatiable hunger for more.</p>
<p>Witches and wizards are drawn to the magic of The Book, but woe
betide any that choose to stand in the way of the inevitable march of
progress, because The Book has a will of its own and a terrible power to
subtly bend its owner’s mind, leaving them just as hungry for more
knowledge.</p>
<p>At first, The Book seems like a blessing, but it might also be termed
a curse. That’s because it always seems to draw unwanted attention, but
never to itself, and its owners become magnets for trouble of all sorts.
Accusations of witchcraft often follow them, because science beyond the
wildest imaginings of the common man may as well be magic.</p>

<h2 id="plan">Release Plan</h2>
<p>Currently, the plan is to release this series in a manner that
resembles television, with episodes consisting of up to four chapters
and seasons roughly ten episodes long. Each novel of the series will be
analogous to a season of a show.</p>
<p>Each season will be initially free to read on <a
href="https://www.royalroad.com">Royal Road</a>. When each season has
been fully posted, it will be published both in Ebook and print
editions. Eventually, the story will be stubbed (become a handful of
sample chapters that drive visitors to stores) on Royal Road, but not
until the series is complete.</p>
<p>None of the novels will be published as Ebooks on Amazon until the
series has been stubbed, due to exclusivity requirements. The Ebooks
will, however, be available in other online stores.</p>
<p>The first three seasons are done and the first chapter was published
on Monday, January 6, 2025. The rest has been following a chapter at a
time, every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.</p>
<p>Volume one, titled <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/index.html#starwitch">Starwitch</a>, will be
available to purchase on June 27, 2025, as both an Ebook and in
print.</p>

<p>Volume one is <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/starwitch.html">Starwitch</a>.</p>
<p>The series begins with Amelia Blackwell, a witch with little magic
talent, but a keen mind, described by the previous owner of The Book as
a prodigy. She accepts ownership of it with curiosity and a voracious
desire to read all she can.</p>
<p>The Book soon gets Amelia and her two older sisters into all sorts of
trouble, because the depth of knowledge Amelia demonstrates breeds
jealousy, strife and accusations of witchcraft for all the wrong
reasons.</p>
<p>Eventually, Amelia constructs a vessel she names <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/starwitch.html">Starwitch</a> and the sisters flee the moon they
once called home, to seek peace among the stars. Instead, they find even
greater strife and a hostile pirate queen that consumes the souls of
witches to extend her own life.</p>
<p>Volume one, titled <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/index.html#starwitch">Starwitch</a>, is available
<a href="https://books2read.com/LegacyOfNewts">in Ebook, print</a>, and
there’s <a

on Royal Road</a></span> Volume two, <em>Legacy of Newts</em>, deals
with the consequences of events from volume one.</p>
<p>Having defeated the pirate queen to rescue her sisters from serving
as fuel for that ancient witch’s life, Amelia flees, but the undead
witch is furious beyond measure and gives chase, determined to run them
down. Even better, the sisters stole her spell-core, leaving the giant,
granite ship dead in space.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that only buys them a little time and the Dead Queen
soon has her ship moving again, to chase after them.</p>
<p>Marta is in bad shape, her soul still linked to that of the Queen,
while Iris grows ever closer to death, due to the magic used to
interrogate her.</p>
<p>The sisters seek assistance from everyone they’ve befriended at every
port along the way, while Amelia plots to gather an armada at the end of
the road.</p>
<p>The pirates are soon up in arms, because the Dead Queen’s lieutenants
smell blood in the water. Things are poised to go from bad to worse,
because sometimes the devil you know is better than the one waiting to
fill the power vacuum…</p>

on Royal Road</a></span> Volume three is <em>The Next Horizon</em>. It
provides greater detail on The Book and the way it interacts with
Amelia.</p>
<p>The two of them come into direct conflict as Amelia decides to go
back to her home world, to reconnect with the man she loves, while The
Book insists on exploring space. As a result, The Book takes back the
gifts it’s given and Amelia loses the ability to perform vast swaths of
advanced mathematics.</p>
<p>Without that, she can’t plot a direct course through space and she’s
forced to rely on the navigation tables of the Ice Palaces, a grueling,
nine month journey home, rather than a quick few days. With such a long
delay, Amelia is practically assured her man will have moved on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an old enemy from her home world, Lieutenant Colonel
Denholm, launches herself into space with only one thought on her mind:
revenge on Amelia for betraying king and country.</p>
<p>Worse, Denholm is met in orbit by the pirate Captain, Edwina
“Roaring” Rowley, who’s also taken umbrage with Amelia over a matter of
a broken promise.</p>
<p>With conflict looming at every turn, will Amelia get home safely and
find her man, or will everything she cares about be taken from her?</p>

<h2 id="witchhome">Witchhome</h2>

<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/../../images/Cover-Witchhome.jpg" /></span> In volume four, titled
<em>Witchhome</em>, Amelia will arrive at a compromise with The Book
they can both live with.</p>
<p>Amelia builds a magic, flying city to serve as a home and place of
refuge while she explores space, a compromise between her desire to put
down roots and the ceaseless need of The Book to go further.</p>
<p>Her massive construction project soon draws attention from all over
the system. Witches and wizards flock to her cause, drawn like moths to
a flame by the potential. Dwarves first supply the resources required,
but soon see the allure of the project and lend a helping hand, that
they might find the same kind of refuge from prejudice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it isn’t all good news, and the locals of Amelia’s
home moon soon rise up, to burn the “cursed city of witches” to the
ground. To avoid all-out war, Amelia’s people are forced to launch
early, before even basic safety measures can be tested.</p>
<p>Will Amelia manage to have her cake and eat it too, or will all the
troubles she seeks to escape finally catch up to her? Will her people be
able to finish their work along the way, or will <em>Witchhome</em> come
apart before they can reach assistance?</p>

<h2 id="beyond-the-horizon">Beyond the Horizon</h2>

<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/../../images/Cover-BeyondTheHorizon.jpg" /></span> In volume five,
<em>Beyond the Horizon</em>, Amelia will finally begin exploring, as the
means to find a place her people can call home.</p>
<p>Amelia flies her magic city full of brave witches, wizards and
dwarves to unexplored space, for the sake of establishing a colony where
they won’t be persecuted for their magical talents.</p>
<p>They carry with them seeds and animals of every kind, with which to
make a new home, plus a population composed of every walk of life,
including every skill that might be required both along the way and at
their destination.</p>
<p>The journey is perilous beyond measure, with strange encounters
aplenty, including lethal space weather, aliens with unfathomable
motives and a hazardous encounter with a black hole.</p>
<p>Will Amelia’s people be able to find a world suitable for
terraforming and the construction of a new home, or will their journey
end with disaster, for over-reaching their grasp? Will Amelia be able to
resist naming that planet Witchworld?</p>
