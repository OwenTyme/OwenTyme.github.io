on Royal Road</a></span> Forced to give up their original home due to
the constant incursions of humans, the fairies long ago retreated from
Earth to an out of the way corner of the galaxy to live in peace, but
when humans accidentally stumble upon them, they aren’t happy and this
time, they’re not willing to give up their home without fighting until
either the extinction of themselves or the human invaders!</p>
<p>However, nothing’s as it seems, because the humans only arrived as
the result of a series of accidents, having been forced to make an
unsafe faster-than-light jump through space to the nearest potentially
habitable system, which resulted in the destruction of their star ship!
With nowhere else to go and faced with the hostile locals, they
staunchly defend themselves against constant fey assault.</p>
<p>Two soldiers on opposite sides, pixie Commander Stargazer Candleflash
and human Sergeant Edwin Harris, find their fates forever entwined,
first by hatred and the desire for revenge, but then, as they crash
together in a rainforest full of danger, they’re forced to work
together, just to survive.</p>
<p>Will these two rivals, who have every reason to hate each other,
survive or will their bickering get them killed? Is it possible a
fragile peace can be forged from their own personal cease-fire or will
the doomsday weapons held by both sides be released, ensuring the
destruction of everyone?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img

</span> Nicole Jacobs wants to reassemble the ancient and magical City
of Kurg, but as a result of a recent battle, pieces of the city were
scattered all over her world. Worse, unlike the ones scattered around
the galaxy, which constantly talk to her, nagging to be whole again,
they’re quiet and deactivated.</p>
<p>As she struggles with the question of how to find them, she senses a
piece of the city coming to life again and she’s drawn like a moth to
the flame, to an ancient ruin built by the stone men that made the city.
There, she meets a dwarf history miner, who holds the piece, which is
folded up like a little coin.</p>
<p>More interesting, however, is an amber lens in his possession that
shows glimpses of the past and future when looked through. Even more
odd, it’s been whispering into the dwarf’s mind. The strange object is
presented to the stone men, who know what it is: it’s a piece of the
Seventh Sage, one of their people with a prophetic gift.</p>
<p>Nicole leads a team on a series of missions to collect the Sage in
the hopes he can locate the missing pieces of Kurg. The journey is harsh
and emotionally painful, because Nicole is forced to kill, not just
once, but three times, leaving her distraught, because she wishes she’d
found another way.</p>
<p>Collecting the last piece is especially difficult, forcing her to
test her resolve with the life of a friend hanging in the balance.</p>
<p>Nicole completes the Sage, but little does she know, a great and
powerful enemy lurks within his mind, an ancient and powerful witch
whose powers are in a class of their own.</p>
<p>Will Nicole rise to the challenge and fulfill prophesy by becoming
the Leader of the stone men, or will the parasitic soul that’s taken
over the Sage steal her fate?</p>

<p><em>Jigsaw City</em> is a sequel series to <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../wizards-scion/index.html">The Wizard’s Scion</a>, centered

<p>Currently, the plan is to release this series a chapter at a time, on

been fully posted, they’ll be published both in Ebook and print
editions, in many online stores.</p>
<p>For the time being, the Ebooks <em>will not</em> be published via
Amazon, because they have exclusivity requirements.</p>
<p>Eventually, the versions in their original, online locations will
become short teasers, perhaps six chapters long.</p>
<p>The first chapter of volume one was published on Saturday, March 8,
2025. The rest will follow a chapter at a time, every Tuesday, Thursday
and Saturday.</p>

explored region of the galaxy, war breaks out between humans that are
forced to land there and the fairies that left Earth during World War
II, because the human race had become too violent to share a planet

<p><em>Fey Fighters</em> introduces true fairies to the setting, who

the fact that the City of Kurg is permanently bonded to her mind and
soul, Nicole seeks to collect all of the missing fragments of the
magical city from her home world.</p>
<p>The trouble is, the remaining pieces on her planet were deactivated
and don’t speak to her in the irritating way the pieces among the stars
do, leaving her frustrated.</p>
<p>Just as she’s researching ways to locate them, a deactivated piece of
the city comes to life and Nicole leads the collection mission, herself.
She meets a dwarf history miner that’s just found both a piece of Kurg
and a fragment of one of the stone men that built Kurg, which whispers
into his mind.</p>
<p>The fragment turns out to be a piece of the Seventh Sage, a mad
prophet that can see the future.</p>
<p>Convinced the Sage knows where the missing pieces of Kurg are, Nicole
collects the rest of him, but the journey is emotionally perilous and
along the way, Nicole is forced to take three lives, by her own
hand.</p>
<p>Just as she’s reeling from the consequences, she completes the Sage,
not knowing it harbors a parasitic soul that’s taken over: one of the
most powerful necromancers that’s ever lived. The ancient witch seeks to
defeat Nicole and take her place in the Sage’s prophesies.</p>
<p>Will Nicole win the day, or will the witch steal both her soul and
her fate?</p>
<p><em>Stone Prophet</em> brings Nicole’s adopted mother into the
series, as Nicole encounters her in the most disreputable port on the
ocean side of the planet.</p>

the fragments of Kurg on her home planet, Nicole turns her gaze upward,
to the stars of the Milky Way, soon coming into conflict with ancient
monsters, aliens, gun-slinging snails, monkeys with crossbows, giants
and even fairies.</p>
<p>This one is likely to be a collection of short, but connected tales,
rather than a novel, with each planet visited being its own story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/Cover-BabaYagaLives.jpg" /></span> Baba Yaga started
out wanting to live a little longer, falling to the temptations of
necromancy to extend her life, gaining a mere decade or so with each
human soul she consumes. Eventually growing dissatisfied with such
meager fare, she turns her attention to consuming the souls of magical
creatures for the extra power they contain and her body slowly becomes
more magic than flesh, transforming her into a thaumavore.</p>
<p>However, with the rise of science and magical creatures of the galaxy
growing wise to her tricks, there’s precious little for her to eat. She
can’t afford the hefty price enchanted items sell for on the galactic
market and finds their weak magic unsatisfying, anyway, but she does
come across a rare and undervalued curio: one of the hexagonal coins
that make up the magical City of Kurg, an object so impossibly filled
with magic, it has the power to resist her every attempt to consume
it!</p>
<p>She seeks to unlock the hidden power of the coin, hoping to extend
her life until the end of time with its nearly limitless magic.
Unfortunately for her, not just anyone can access the magic of Kurg,
something only a city administrator can do. Learning this fact by
touching the mind of the coin, she seeks a conversation with Nicole, the
only available administrator.</p>
<p>Nicole’s quest to collect the missing pieces of the City of Kurg
brings her right to Baba Yaga’s doorstep and since their goals are
nothing alike and totally at odds, the meeting devolves into a magical
duel! War for ownership of the city follows, eventually leading to a
sprawling battle inside the legendary chicken-legged hut of Baba Yaga, a
magically-folded, mind-bending space that would give even M. C. Escher a
headache!</p>
<p>Will Nicole overcome the crone’s superior, time-tested spells or will
Nicole, as an extension of Kurg, become Baba Yaga’s living larder?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Baba Yaga Lives!</em> will bring legendary magical creatures to
the city, including Levi’s old familiar, Inorath, because Nicole will
need information on Baba Yaga and many of them are even older than the
ancient witch.</p>

<em>Jigsaw City</em>, the true purpose of Kurg is revealed: it was
designed as a powerful weapon for fighting a war that’s as old as the
universe. The Life Giver is back, in need of Nicole and her city’s
power, while the Life Giver’s nemesis, The Void, attempts to invade the
Milky Way, to begin consuming everyone and everything there.</p>
<p><em>The Great Purpose</em> will bring the Hunter from <a
href="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../ashen-blades/index.html">Ashen Blades</a> to the city, to
combat a nearly limitless supply of demons, because they’ve finally
succeeded in opening a stable portal to the galaxy. It will also involve
the Hunter’s arch-nemesis, Vogerath, since the portal was his plan.</p>

may have won the battle with demon-kind and The Void, but the cost is
extremely high: Nicole sacrifices her life for the success of their
crazy suicide mission and the Hunter finally reaches the limits of both
her demon and witch powers, with disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Nicole’s body is restored by automatic functions of the City of Kurg,
but her mind is shattered by re-birth as its living avatar. Lost,
confused and alone, will Nicole ever return to her home and those she
loves or will she forever wander a dying, parallel universe, seeking a
home she can’t even remember?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Hunter is also lost and alone, but in immediate peril.
She emerges from the spatial tear formed by The Void’s final kick at
thirty-thousand feet above a strange, alien planet, with absolutely no
idea where she is. Even worse, she’s lost the power of the elements and
been left to her own devices, totally unable to fly. Will she survive
the fall and find some way to get home or will she remain forever
lost?</p>

<h2 id="the-memory-hunt">The Memory Hunt</h2>
<p><img src="https://owentyme.us/books/jigsaw-city/../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>Nicole discovers the fact that her memories were backed up by the
city before she was killed, but unlike her body, it was unable to fully
restore her mind.</p>
<p>Seeking to regain a greater measure of humanity, Nicole goes back to
collecting lost fragments of the City of Kurg, mostly for the sake of
restoring her memories.</p>
<p>This takes her beyond the galaxy she knows, to far-flung areas of the
multiverse, because when the ancient city broke up, parts of it left the
galaxy, while some few traveled to parallel universes.</p>

Royal Road</a></span> Nicole Jacobs is twenty years old and unsure what
direction to take in life, because the opportunities available to her
are too numerous and no one job fits all of her talents, but she passes
the time doing research on dragons. To that end, she hatches a dragon
egg, but in the midst of the harrowing work required, she dreams of the
ancient, magical City of Kurg, which yearns to be whole.</p>
<p>She soon discovers, based on a chance encounter with a small magic
item she’d been analyzing, that her mind has been dangerously
intertwined with that of the city, which spreads through her brain like
a disease, slowly taking over. At first, she’s able to keep it under
control by suppressing magic within her own head, but over time, it
begins breaking past the road blocks she desperately erects in its path
as it inches toward total control.</p>
<p>Seeking a cure, she’s forced to research the ancient city, while the
clock ticks down on her sanity and ultimately, her life. Meeting the
strange, stone men that made the city, the Ulkun, she finds they have
few answers for her, but suggest that if she locates the Architect of
Kurg, one of their own kind, he might be of some help. Unfortunately,
due to the fact he was trapped inside a small segment of the sealed city
for millions of years, alone, he’s quite insane, unhelpful and worse,
eventually becomes hostile, forming a plan for galactic domination.</p>
<p>Instead, Nicole seeks the Life Giver, the mysterious being that
created the Ulkun and ordered the construction of Kurg, while collecting
pieces of the city, in the hopes of attracting their attention.</p>
<p>Will Nicole find a cure, freeing herself from the clutches of Kurg,
or will she lose control of her own mind, taken over by the magic city?
Will the Architect succeed at replacing everyone in the galaxy with
obedient, magically-animated drones with no will of their own or will
Nicole stop him?</p>

queen, Amelia and her sisters enjoy a short time of peace, until she
decides to go home, to Cakana. She wants to reconnect with a man she
fell in love with, but The Book of Newts has other plans.</p>
<p>When the conflict comes to a head, The Book refuses to cooperate and
takes back the gifts it’s been quietly imparting. As a result, Amelia
discovers it’s been bolstering her exceptional ability with mathematics
and piloting. Left to her own devices, the task of navigating space
becomes potentially deadly, because she can no longer perform the
required calculations in her head, or on paper.</p>
<p>Without that, the journey home will take nine months, rather than
mere days, practically ensuring the man she loves will have moved
on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a duo of deadly witches they left behind, and hoped never
to see again, have since learned to fly through space and wish for a
helping of revenge. Lieutenant Colonel Scarth Denholm is furious with
Amelia for betraying her and she’s got Captain Kristina “Killer” Krauss
with her. Worse, they’re welcomed into space by one of the last pirates,
Captain Edwina “Roaring” Rowley, who also has a bone to pick with Amelia
and her sisters.</p>
<p>Will Amelia survive long enough to reignite the love she once had, or
will she be forced to give up her greatest desire, just to satisfy The

ancient, undead witch known as the Dead Queen and Amelia attacked the
pirate’s mountain-sized star ship out of pure desperation. She never
expected to actually rescue her sisters, let alone defeat the pirate on
her own ship. Nonetheless, she pulled it off, got her sisters back and
left the pirate queen’s ship helplessly listing through space.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Blackwell sisters, that’s only the beginning,
because the Dead Queen survived and she’s absolutely livid. She seeks
revenge, because the sisters made her look weak, forcing her to save
face by killing them, lest her own lieutenants kill her.</p>
<p>Worse, the soul of Amelia’s oldest sister, Marta, has been
intertwined with that of the Dead Queen, who was using necromancy to
consume it, to extend her own life. That leaves them both stumbling
through the thoughts of the other, each looking for some advantage in a
battle of soul vs. soul, winner take all – even though Marta has no
desire to steal the undead witch’s soul.</p>
<p>Iris, the middle sister, fares no better. Since she managed to resist
interrogation by torture, the Dead Queen instead forced an addiction on
her, offering hits of a pleasure spell for information, until she broke.
Her brain chemistry is so screwed up, she’s unlikely to survive
withdrawal.</p>
<p>The Queen soon gets her ship moving and the chase is on! Will the
Blackwells find refuge and allies to fight off the Queen’s massive ship,
or will everyone shun them, unwilling to take the risk of standing up to
the queen of the pirates, who terrifies even the rulers of the star
system?</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-book-of-newts">The Book of Newts</h1>
<p><span class="book-cover"><img
src="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/../../images/Cover-TheBookOfNewts.jpg" /></span> <em>The Book of
Newts</em> is a remarkable volume. Paradoxically, while The Book is
exceptionally magical, the information contained within is largely not.
It details every wonder of engineering, science and astronomy that’s
been discovered by its past owners, but this information is only visible
to those with a genetic talent for mathematics. To all others, it
appears to be a thick volume describing every variation of newt that has
ever existed, in meticulous detail, complete with hand-drawn
illustrations.</p>
<p>The Book yearns for new knowledge. To that end, it inspires those
that own it to ever greater heights, taking them to the stars and
beyond, to reach their greatest potential, but nothing in life comes
without a price and its owners rarely foresee the balance coming
due.</p>
<p>While The Book is sometimes willing to wait, it’s never satisfied and
will always drive its owner to the next horizon, to the next discovery,
that it might grow a little thicker under the weight of new
knowledge.</p>
<p>Throughout history, The Book has been the driving factor behind many
things, particularly the colonization of the stars and terraforming of
many worlds, all to serve its insatiable hunger for more.</p>
<p>Witches and wizards are drawn to the magic of The Book, but woe
betide any that choose to stand in the way of the inevitable march of
progress, because The Book has a will of its own and a terrible power to
subtly bend its owner’s mind, leaving them just as hungry for more
knowledge.</p>
<p>At first, The Book seems like a blessing, but it might also be termed
a curse. That’s because it always seems to draw unwanted attention, but
never to itself, and its owners become magnets for trouble of all sorts.
Accusations of witchcraft often follow them, because science beyond the
wildest imaginings of the common man may as well be magic.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="plan">Release Plan</h2>
<p>Currently, the plan is to release this series in a manner that
resembles television, with episodes consisting of up to four chapters
and seasons roughly ten episodes long. Each novel of the series will be
analogous to a season of a show.</p>
<p>Each season will be initially free to read on <a
href="https://www.royalroad.com">Royal Road</a>. When each season has
been fully posted, it will be published both in Ebook and print
editions. Eventually, the story will be stubbed (become a handful of
sample chapters that drive visitors to stores) on Royal Road, but not
until the series is complete.</p>
<p>None of the novels will be published as Ebooks on Amazon until the
series has been stubbed, due to exclusivity requirements. The Ebooks
will, however, be available in other online stores.</p>
<p>The first three seasons are done and the first chapter was published
on Monday, January 6, 2025. The rest has been following a chapter at a
time, every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.</p>
<p>Volume one, titled <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/index.html#starwitch">Starwitch</a>, will be
available to purchase on June 27, 2025, as both an Ebook and in
print.</p>

a prodigy. She accepts ownership of it with curiosity and a voracious
desire to read all she can.</p>
<p>The Book soon gets Amelia and her two older sisters into all sorts of
trouble, because the depth of knowledge Amelia demonstrates breeds
jealousy, strife and accusations of witchcraft for all the wrong
reasons.</p>
<p>Eventually, Amelia constructs a vessel she names <a

<p>Having defeated the pirate queen to rescue her sisters from serving

granite ship dead in space.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that only buys them a little time and the Dead Queen
soon has her ship moving again, to chase after them.</p>
<p>Marta is in bad shape, her soul still linked to that of the Queen,
while Iris grows ever closer to death, due to the magic used to
interrogate her.</p>

<p>The pirates are soon up in arms, because the Dead Queen’s lieutenants

provides greater detail on The Book and the way it interacts with
Amelia.</p>
<p>The two of them come into direct conflict as Amelia decides to go
back to her home world, to reconnect with the man she loves, while The
Book insists on exploring space. As a result, The Book takes back the
gifts it’s given and Amelia loses the ability to perform vast swaths of
advanced mathematics.</p>
<p>Without that, she can’t plot a direct course through space and she’s
forced to rely on the navigation tables of the Ice Palaces, a grueling,
nine month journey home, rather than a quick few days. With such a long
delay, Amelia is practically assured her man will have moved on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an old enemy from her home world, Lieutenant Colonel
Denholm, launches herself into space with only one thought on her mind:
revenge on Amelia for betraying king and country.</p>
<p>Worse, Denholm is met in orbit by the pirate Captain, Edwina
“Roaring” Rowley, who’s also taken umbrage with Amelia over a matter of
a broken promise.</p>
<p>With conflict looming at every turn, will Amelia get home safely and

<em>Witchhome</em>, Amelia will arrive at a compromise with The Book
they can both live with.</p>
<p>Amelia builds a magic, flying city to serve as a home and place of
refuge while she explores space, a compromise between her desire to put
down roots and the ceaseless need of The Book to go further.</p>
<p>Her massive construction project soon draws attention from all over
the system. Witches and wizards flock to her cause, drawn like moths to
a flame by the potential. Dwarves first supply the resources required,
but soon see the allure of the project and lend a helping hand, that
they might find the same kind of refuge from prejudice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it isn’t all good news, and the locals of Amelia’s
home moon soon rise up, to burn the “cursed city of witches” to the
ground. To avoid all-out war, Amelia’s people are forced to launch
early, before even basic safety measures can be tested.</p>
<p>Will Amelia manage to have her cake and eat it too, or will all the
troubles she seeks to escape finally catch up to her? Will her people be
able to finish their work along the way, or will <em>Witchhome</em> come
apart before they can reach assistance?</p>

<em>Beyond the Horizon</em>, Amelia will finally begin exploring, as the
means to find a place her people can call home.</p>
<p>Amelia flies her magic city full of brave witches, wizards and
dwarves to unexplored space, for the sake of establishing a colony where
they won’t be persecuted for their magical talents.</p>
<p>They carry with them seeds and animals of every kind, with which to
make a new home, plus a population composed of every walk of life,
including every skill that might be required both along the way and at
their destination.</p>
<p>The journey is perilous beyond measure, with strange encounters
aplenty, including lethal space weather, aliens with unfathomable
motives and a hazardous encounter with a black hole.</p>
<p>Will Amelia’s people be able to find a world suitable for
terraforming and the construction of a new home, or will their journey
end with disaster, for over-reaching their grasp? Will Amelia be able to
resist naming that planet Witchworld?</p>

<p>Starwitch is volume one of <a href="https://owentyme.us/books/book-of-newts/index.html">The Book of
Newts</a>, which follows the adventures and trials of a witch that owns
a magical book detailing many secrets of science, engineering, magic and
most particularly, space travel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"><a

<a
href="https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/102509/the-book-of-newts">Read
on Royal Road</a></span> Home, safety, and a place to belong – they seem
so easy to find, at least for everyone but Amelia Blackwell and her
sisters, who run from accusations of witchcraft at every turn.</p>
<p>It started so simply, with a book. No one might have predicted that a
book apparently filled with pictures of newts might lead to so much
trouble, but <em>The Book of Newts</em> is no ordinary volume on
taxonomic detail of amphibians. The magic book reveals its true nature
only to Amelia, at the age of ten, teaching her mathematics, science and
engineering – subjects she would not otherwise have been exposed to.</p>
<p>Ironically, she and her sisters are accused of witchcraft for having
built a horseless carriage, because to the ignorant villagers, there’s
no difference between magic and science. They settle in a new land, only
to find the same breed of persecution.</p>
<p>In an unusual ray of hope, they’re told of a distant kingdom that
openly accepts witches, but shortly after they settle there, the light
at the end of the tunnel turns out to be an awful house fire surrounding
their gilded cage: they’re drafted into the local military, because
their new nation uses witches as living weapons.</p>
<p>The sisters accept the idea that peace will never be found on the
ground. Looking to the stars, Amelia builds a space vessel powered by
magic and steam, to carry them to a brighter future, hopefully without
the strife that’s always followed them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the people of the stars have their own worries: an
ancient, undead pirate queen, who consumes the souls of powerful witches
to extend her own life. The Dead Queen takes Amelia’s sisters and leaves
the magically-weak engineer to die, all as a sick form of sport.</p>
<p>Will Amelia survive long enough to overcome this greatest of all
threats and rescue her sisters, or will they become fuel to feed the

Starwitch by Owen Tyme</a></p>
<p><em>Starwitch</em> centers on the life of Amelia Blackwell, the
youngest of a trio of sisters and witches, who start out living on a
moon orbiting a gas giant and eventually use magic to launch themselves
into space, to escape persecution for their witchcraft, as well as some
troublesome political events.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they eventually encounter the Dead Queen, an ancient
undead pirate witch that consumes the magic and lives of other witches,
to extend her own existence.</p>
<p>The series begins with Amelia aboard her magic light sail ship,
<em>Starwitch</em>, just a few days after it was badly damaged and her
sisters were kidnapped by the Dead Queen, left with only enough
resources to follow the far larger ship.</p>
<p>That’s an intentional and cruel choice by the Dead Queen, because
Amelia’s magic is deemed too weak to consume. The Queen instead left
Amelia for dead in the hopes of some sport.</p>
<p>Amelia has just enough resources to attack, but not enough to limp to
safety, so unless she gets back either the mythril spell-core of her
ship or at least one of her sisters, she’s a dead woman.</p>
