<h1 id="rumors-of-war">Rumors of War</h1>
<p>Despite the inevitable side conflict, this series centers around one
war in particular: a conflict between a race of intelligent machines and
the organic life of the galaxy, but unlike most such tales, the heroes
of this story are from a world of magic, which may be the only hope for
the galaxy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <img
src="../../images/Cover-TrollWar.jpg" /> </span> In a war between
dwarves and trolls, which side would win? – That’s the question asked by
a pair of nobles who set out to answer it, by fooling a kingdom of
dwarves and a kingdom of trolls into thinking the other made the first
move.</p>
<p>Years pass and the fighting spills into a neighboring human kingdom.
Staff Sergeant Jane “Sureshot” Stanton is charged with a dangerous
mission by the human king: end the war, at any cost. The battle fatigued
human sharpshooter initially refuses a rifle, because she can’t use one
without traumatic flashbacks.</p>
<p>An alien anthropologist, Brosla Ghinead, offers to join the mission,
because evil, sentient machines are on the way and the locals need to
become a unified force, lest they die! He’s convinced magic is vital for
protecting the galaxy and ending the machine scourge.</p>
<p>Sureshot’s mission proves perilous at every turn and diplomacy
quickly fails, forcing her to conclude the troll Queen must die to make
way for peace.</p>
With the stakes so high, will Sureshot pick up a rifle? Will she and
Brosla manage to put the wily troll Queen down before the machines
arrive and will the survivors be strong enough to fight?

<h2 id="ai-war">Machine War</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>The second volume of <em>Rumors of War</em> focuses on the
consequences of the climactic orbital battle from the end of the
previous book. Among all the debris falling from orbit are many sentient
machines, who go to work consuming resources, so they can continue their
relentless campaign against the galaxy.</p>
<p>The alien machines arrive on the planet in gooey, egg-like enclosures
designed to serve as disposable entry capsules, leaving them initially
covered in an extra layer of armor-like ablative plastic, making the
first waves of shock-troops all the more deadly.</p>
<p>The ground war focuses on wiping out the machines before they can
build an FTL transmitter to call for backup, while the few machines left
in orbit scramble to put out fires and shut down a dangerously unstable
reactor, which they hope to repair, that they might get a transmitter of
their own working.</p>
<p>Former enemies become allies as the locals band together for the sake
of their lives, scrambling to present a unified front against the
machines, which spread like a plague over the three kingdoms, while the
gnomes work with the surviving aliens to produce a weapon capable of
destroying what remains of the orbiting machine warship, because it’s in
a better position to send a long-range signal.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="magic-war">Magic War</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>The events of <em>Machine War</em> largely went unregarded by the
leader of the machines, who was focused on other things, but when the
gnomes blasted its damaged warship out of orbit with a magic laser
cannon so powerful, it punched a hole right through the moon, the
machine overlord finally takes notice of the strange events!</p>
<p>With the planet having finally caught the eye of the entire swarm,
every resource available is sent to the lone world that’s been capable
of resisting, leading to all-out war between the people of that world
and the machines.</p>
<p>The machines begin a detailed analysis of magic, seeking to capture
wizards, witches and fairies, that they might study the phenomenon under
laboratory conditions. Eventually, magic items are also captured. Over
time, the machines begin to grasp the subtleties of magic, adapting it
for their own use.</p>
<p>The war takes on new intensity as the machines begin employing
enchanted weaponry and wizards of their own…</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="galaxy-war">Galaxy War</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>Having successfully repelled the machine swarm, which backs off to
calculate a new strategy, the trolls, dwarves and their allies turn
their eyes upward, working with the surviving aliens and the gnomes to
build star ships, that they might take the fight to the machines, hoping
to end them once and for all.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="dimension-war">Dimension War</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>Having weaseled out of the trap set by the dwarves and trolls, the
master of the machines runs, taking refuge in another dimension occupied
by the ancient race that seeded the galaxy with humanoid life, before
they moved on.</p>
<p>Giving chase, the dwarves and trolls meet the gods of every species
in the galaxy. Gods fight side by side with mortals to eradicate the
fate-defying machine before it can finish its study of their divine
physiology, in hopes of surpassing them.</p>
