<h1 id="the-book-of-newts">The Book of Newts</h1>
<p><em>The Book of Newts</em> is a remarkable volume. Paradoxically,
while The Book is exceptionally magical, the information contained
within is largely not. It details every wonder of engineering, science
and astronomy that’s been discovered by its past owners, but this
information is only visible to its owner. To all others, it appears to
be a thick volume describing every variation of newt that has ever
existed, in meticulous detail, complete with hand-drawn
illustrations.</p>
<p>The Book yearns for new knowledge. To that end, it inspires those
that own it to ever greater heights, taking them to the stars and
beyond, to reach their greatest potential, but nothing in life comes
without a price and its owners rarely foresee the balance coming
due.</p>
<p>While The Book is sometimes willing to wait, it’s never satisfied and
will always drive its owner to the next horizon, to the next discovery,
that it might grow a little thicker under the weight of new
knowledge.</p>
<p>Throughout history, The Book has been the driving factor behind many
things, particularly the colonization of the stars and terraforming of
many worlds, all to serve its insatiable hunger for more.</p>
<p>Witches and wizards are drawn to the magic of The Book, but woe
betide any that choose to stand in the way of the inevitable march of
progress, because The Book has a will of its own and a terrible power to
subtly bend its owner’s mind, leaving them just as hungry for more
knowledge.</p>
<p>At first, The Book seems like a blessing, but it might also be termed
a curse. That’s because it always seems to draw unwanted attention, but
never to itself, and its owners become magnets for trouble of all sorts.
Accusations of witchcraft often follow the owner, because science beyond
the wildest imaginings of the common man may as well be magic.</p>
<h2 id="plan">Release Plan</h2>
<p>Currently, the plan is to release this series in a manner that
resembles television, with episodes consisting of up to four chapters
and seasons about ten episodes long. Each novel of the series will be
analogous to a season of a show.</p>
<p>Each season will be initially free to read on <a
href="https://www.royalroad.com">Royal Road</a>, <a
href="https://www.wattpad.com">Wattpad</a> and possibly <a
href="https://medium.com">Medium</a>. When the next season is ready to
be posted, the old season will be published both in Ebook and print
editions, while the versions in their original, online locations will
become one or two episode teasers.</p>
<p>The first season is done and the first chapter was published on
Monday, January 6, 2025. The rest of will follow a chapter at a time,
every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.</p>

on Wattpad</button></a> </span> Volume one is <a
href="starwitch.html">Starwitch</a>.</p>
<p>The series begins with Amelia Blackwell, a witch with little magic
talent, but a keen mind, described by the previous owner of The Book as
a prodigy. She accepts ownership of it with curiosity and a voracious
desire to read all she can.</p>
<p>The Book soon gets Amelia and her two older sisters into all sorts of
trouble, because the depth of knowledge Amelia demonstrates breeds
jealousy, strife and accusations of witchcraft for all the wrong
reasons.</p>
<p>Eventually, Amelia constructs a vessel she names <a
href="starwitch.html">Starwitch</a> and the sisters flee the moon they
once called home, to seek peace among the stars. Instead, they find even
greater strife and a hostile pirate queen that consumes the souls of
witches to extend her own life.</p>
<h2 id="the-pirates-legacy">The Pirate’s Legacy</h2>
<p>Volume two is The Pirate’s Legacy and will involve dealing with the
consequences of events from volume one.</p>
<p>Having defeated the pirate queen to rescue her sisters from serving
as fuel for that ancient witch’s life, Amelia flees, but the undead
witch is furious beyond measure and gives chase, determined to run them
down.</p>
<p>The sisters seek assistance from everyone they’ve befriended at every
port along the way, but none of them have any desire to get between the
sisters and their powerful enemy.</p>
<p>There’s soon fighting in every corner of the star system, because the
Dead Queen’s lieutenants smell the blood in the water. Things are poised
to go from bad to worse, because sometimes the devil you know is better
than the one waiting to fill a power vacuum.</p>
<h2 id="the-next-horizon">The Next Horizon</h2>
<p>Volume three is The Next Horizon. It will provide greater detail on
The Book and the way it interacts with Amelia.</p>
<p>After settling the matter of the pirates, Amelia and her sisters
enjoy a short time of peace, until she begins having dreams and visions
that reveal the way to travel from one star to the next, because The
Book has finally grown impatient.</p>
<p>Amelia initially resists, because she desires to return to the moon
she was born on, that she might reconnect with a man she fell in love
with, but The Book won’t leave her alone and becomes a source of great
frustration.</p>
<p>When the conflict comes to a head, The Book refuses to cooperate and
takes back the gifts it’s been quietly imparting. As a result, Amelia
discovers it has been bolstering her exceptional ability with
mathematics and piloting. Left to her own devices, the task of
navigating space becomes potentially deadly, because she can no longer
perform the required calculations in her head.</p>
<p>The journey home becomes perilous and tediously long, compared to
just days before, as everything that can get in the way does and she’s
forced to repeatedly check her math on paper, because her life is on the
line.</p>
<p>Just as Amelia and her sisters are struggling with that, they
encounter a duo of deadly witches they left behind and hoped never to
see again, who have since learned to fly through space and wish for a
helping of revenge.</p>
<p>Will Amelia survive long enough to reignite the love she once had, or
will she be forced to give up her greatest desire, just to satisfy The
Book?</p>
<h2 id="witchhome">Witchhome</h2>
<p>In volume four, titled Witchhome, Amelia will arrive at a compromise
with The Book they can both live with.</p>
<p>Amelia builds a magic, flying city to serve as a home and place of
refuge while she explores space, a compromise between her desire to put
down roots and the ceaseless need of The Book to go further.</p>
<p>Her massive construction project soon draws attention from all over
the system. Witches and wizards flock to her cause, drawn like moths to
a flame by the potential. Dwarves first supply the resources required,
but soon see the allure of the project and lend a helping hand, that
they might find the same kind of refuge from prejudice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it isn’t all good news, and the locals of Amelia’s
home moon soon rise up, to burn the “cursed city of witches” to the
ground. To avoid all-out war, Amelia’s people are forced to launch
early, before even basic safety measures can be tested.</p>
<p>Will Amelia manage to have her cake and eat it too, or will all the
troubles she seeks to escape finally catch up to her? Will her people be
able to finish their work along the way, or will <em>Witchhome</em> come
apart before she can reach assistance?</p>
<h2 id="beyond-the-horizon">Beyond the Horizon</h2>
<p>In volume five, Beyond the Horizon, Amelia will finally begin
exploring, as the means to find a place her people can call home.</p>
<p>Amelia flies her magic city full of brave witches, wizards and
dwarves to unexplored space, for the sake of establishing a colony where
they won’t be persecuted for their magical talents.</p>
<p>They carry with them seeds and animals of every kind, with which to
make a new home, plus a population composed of every walk of life,
including every skill that might be required both along the way and at
their destination.</p>
<p>The journey is perilous beyond measure, with strange encounters
aplenty, including lethal space weather, aliens with unfathomable
motives and a hazardous encounter with a black hole.</p>
<p>Will Amelia’s people be able to find a world suitable for
terraforming and the construction of a new home, or will their journey
end with disaster, for over-reaching their grasp?</p>
