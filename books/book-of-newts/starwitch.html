<h1 id="starwitch">Starwitch</h1>
<p>Starwitch is volume one of <a href="index.html">The Book of
Newts</a>, which follows the adventures and trials of a witch that owns
a magical book detailing many secrets of science, engineering, magic and
most particularly, space travel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <img
src="../../images/Cover-Starwitch.jpg" /> </span> Home, safety, and a
place to belong – they seem so easy to find, at least for everyone but
Amelia Blackwell and her sisters, who run from accusations of witchcraft
at every turn.</p>
<p>It started so simply, with a book. No one might have predicted that a
book apparently filled with pictures of newts might lead to so much
trouble, but <em>The Book of Newts</em> is no ordinary volume on
taxonomic detail of amphibians. The magic book reveals its true nature
only to Amelia, at the age of ten, teaching her mathematics, science and
engineering – subjects she would not otherwise have been exposed to.</p>
<p>Ironically, she and her sisters are accused of witchcraft for having
built a horseless carriage, because to the ignorant villagers, there’s
no difference between magic and science. They settle in a new land, only
to find the same breed of persecution.</p>
<p>In an unusual ray of hope, they’re told of a distant kingdom that
openly accepts witches, but shortly after they settle there, the light
at the end of the tunnel turns out to be an awful house fire surrounding
their gilded cage: they’re drafted into the local military, because
their new nation uses witches as living weapons.</p>
<p>The sisters accept the idea that peace will never be found on the
ground. Looking to the stars, Amelia builds a space vessel powered by
magic and steam, to carry them to a brighter future, hopefully without
the strife that’s always followed them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the people of the stars have their own worries: an
ancient, undead pirate queen, who consumes the souls of powerful witches
to extend her own life. The Dead Queen takes Amelia’s sisters and leaves
the magically-weak engineer to die, all as a sick form of sport.</p>
Will Amelia survive long enough to overcome this greatest of all threats
and rescue her sisters, or will they become fuel to feed the waning
magic of a woman that should have been dead centuries before?

</blockquote>
<p><em>Starwitch</em> centers on the life of Amelia Blackwell, the
youngest of a trio of sisters and witches, who start out living on a
moon and eventually use magic to launch themselves into space, to escape
persecution for their witchcraft and various troublesome political
events.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they eventually encounter the Dead Queen, an ancient
undead pirate witch that consumes the magic and lives of other witches,
to extend her own existence.</p>
<p>The series begins with Amelia aboard her magic light sail ship,
<em>Starwitch</em>, just a few days after it was badly damaged and her
sisters were kidnapped by the Dead Queen, left with only enough
resources to follow the far larger ship.</p>
<p>That’s an intentional and cruel choice by the Dead Queen, because
Amelia’s magic is deemed too weak to consume. She instead left Amelia
for dead in the hopes of some sport, something the Dead Queen has done
to countless weak witches.</p>
<p>Amelia has just enough resources to attack, but not enough to limp to
safety, so unless she gets back either the mythril spell-core of her
ship or at least one of her sisters, she’s a dead woman.</p>
<p><em>Starwitch</em> is currently unpublished, though it will initially
be released as an episodic web series. I’m likely to finish the entire
novel before releasing anything, so it can be consistent from start to
finish.</p>
<p>When it’s ready, it will come in four chapter episodes and the first
book should be composed of ten episodes, for a total of forty
chapters.</p>

<p>If you’re eager to read more before this project is complete, check
out <a href="https://mastodon.social/@OwenTyme/113483873966306253">my
series of posts about it on Mastodon</a>, be beware that you’ll find a
massive number of spoilers for the story. I’ve also been posting weekly
wrap-ups <a href="../../blog/index.html">on my blog</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been mirroring my daily and weekly posts to <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/AuthorOwenTyme/">Facebook</a> and my
weekly posts are mirrored to <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/45452178.Owen_Tyme/blog">my
Goodreads blog</a>.</p>
<h2 id="release-schedule-and-details">Release Schedule and Details</h2>
<p>The series page for the <a href="index.html#plan">The Book of
Newts</a> has the details for this.</p>
<p>The release schedule hasn’t yet been decided, since the first novel
is not finished, but you can check here for updates.</p>
<p>I’ll most likely be posting episodes to <a
href="https://www.royalroad.com">Royal Road</a>, since it seems like a
nice option for serial fantasy, and <a
href="https://www.wattpad.com">Wattpad</a>, since I already have an
account there. I might also try <a
href="https://medium.com">Medium</a>.</p>
<p>I’m planning to run this project similar to a TV show, with each
novel being the equivalent of a season, about ten episodes long.</p>
<p>Only the most current season of the series will be available for free
and when a new season is started, I plan to publish the previous season
in the form of a novel.</p>
<p>If this project does well, I’m more likely to focus on it and write
more material. That could potentially mean up to four seasons per year,
because I typically write a novel every three months.</p>
