<h1 id="series">Jigsaw City</h1>
<p><em>Jigsaw City</em> is a sequel series to <a
href="../wizards-scion/index.html">The Wizard’s Scion</a>, centered
around the life of Levi’s daughter, Nicole Jacobs, and her quest to
reunite the pieces of a magical city that was broken up millions of
years before she was born.</p>
<h2 id="plan">Release Plan</h2>
<p>Currently, the plan is to release this series a chapter at a time, on
<a href="https://www.royalroad.com">Royal Road</a>. When each volume has
been fully posted, they’ll be published both in Ebook and print
editions, in many online stores.</p>
<p>For the time being, the Ebooks <em>will not</em> be published via
Amazon, because they have exclusivity requirements.</p>
<p>Eventually, the versions in their original, online locations will
become short teasers, perhaps six chapters long.</p>
<p>The first chapter of volume one was published on Saturday, March 8,
2025. The rest will follow a chapter at a time, every Tuesday, Thursday
and Saturday.</p>

hexagonal coin for her twentieth birthday, but during analysis of the
strange, magic trinket, she accidentally copies the magic item’s base
spell into her mind, where it rapidly expands beyond the original
design, slowly consuming her mind from the inside! Nicole reluctantly
seeks out the maker of the item, hoping to find a cure before it’s too
late to save her sanity.</p>

barely explored region of the galaxy, war breaks out between humans that
are forced to land there and the fairies that left Earth during World
War II, because the human race had become too violent to share a planet
with.</p>
<p><em>Fey Fighters</em> introduces true fairies to the setting, who
will also be seen in volume four, where they’ll play a vital role
providing exposition and will also play a part in <em>The Great
Purpose</em>, due to the linked nature of both demons and fey.</p>

<p><span class="book-cover"> <a href="stone-prophet.html"><img
src="../../images/Cover-StoneProphet.jpg" /></a> </span> Having accepted
the fact that the City of Kurg is permanently bonded to her mind and
soul, Nicole seeks to collect all of the missing fragments of the
magical city from her home world.</p>
<p>The trouble is, the remaining pieces on her planet were deactivated
and don’t speak to her in the irritating way the pieces among the stars
do, leaving her frustrated.</p>
<p>Just as she’s researching ways to locate them, a deactivated piece of
the city comes to life and Nicole leads the collection mission, herself.
She meets a dwarf history miner that’s just found both a piece of Kurg
and a fragment of one of the stone men that built Kurg, which whispers
into his mind.</p>
<p>The fragment turns out to be a piece of the Seventh Sage, a mad
prophet that can see the future.</p>
<p>Convinced the Sage knows where the missing pieces of Kurg are, Nicole
collects the rest of him, but the journey is emotionally perilous and
along the way, Nicole is forced to take three lives, by her own
hand.</p>
<p>Just as she’s reeling from the consequences, she completes the Sage,
not knowing it harbors a parasitic soul that’s taken over: one of the
most powerful necromancers that’s ever lived. The ancient witch seeks to
defeat Nicole and take her place in the Sage’s prophesies.</p>
<p>Will Nicole win the day, or will the witch steal both her soul and
her fate?</p>
<p><em>Stone Prophet</em> brings Nicole’s adopted mother into the
series, as Nicole encounters her in the most disreputable port on the
ocean side of the planet.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-writing.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <img
src="../../images/Cover-CollectorOfKurg.jpg" /> </span> Having collected
the fragments of Kurg on her home planet, Nicole turns her gaze upward,
to the stars of the Milky Way, soon coming into conflict with ancient
monsters, aliens, gun-slinging snails, monkeys with crossbows, giants
and even fairies.</p>
<p>This one is likely to be a collection of short, but connected tales,
rather than a novel, with each planet visited being its own story.</p>

<h2 id="baba-yaga-lives">Baba Yaga Lives!</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <img
src="../../images/Cover-BabaYagaLives.jpg" /> </span> Baba Yaga started
out wanting to live a little longer, falling to the temptations of
necromancy to extend her life, gaining a mere decade or so with each
human soul she consumes. Eventually growing dissatisfied with such
meager fare, she turns her attention to consuming the souls of magical
creatures for the extra power they contain and her body slowly becomes
more magic than flesh, transforming her into a thaumavore.</p>
<p>However, with the rise of science and magical creatures of the galaxy
growing wise to her tricks, there’s precious little for her to eat. She
can’t afford the hefty price enchanted items sell for on the galactic
market and finds their weak magic unsatisfying, anyway, but she does
come across a rare and undervalued curio: one of the hexagonal coins
that make up the magical City of Kurg, an object so impossibly filled
with magic, it has the power to resist her every attempt to consume
it!</p>
<p>She seeks to unlock the hidden power of the coin, hoping to extend
her life until the end of time with its nearly limitless magic.
Unfortunately for her, not just anyone can access the magic of Kurg,
something only a city administrator can do. Learning this fact by
touching the mind of the coin, she seeks a conversation with Nicole, the
only available administrator.</p>
<p>Nicole’s quest to collect the missing pieces of the City of Kurg
brings her right to Baba Yaga’s doorstep and since their goals are
nothing alike and totally at odds, the meeting devolves into a magical
duel! War for ownership of the city follows, eventually leading to a
sprawling battle inside the legendary chicken-legged hut of Baba Yaga, a
magically-folded, mind-bending space that would give even M. C. Escher a
headache!</p>
Will Nicole overcome the crone’s superior, time-tested spells or will
Nicole, as an extension of Kurg, become Baba Yaga’s living larder?
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Baba Yaga Lives!</em> will bring legendary magical creatures to
the city, including Levi’s old familiar, Inorath, because Nicole will
need information on Baba Yaga and many of them are even older than the
ancient witch.</p>
<h2 id="the-great-purpose">The Great Purpose</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <img
src="../../images/Cover-TheGreatPurpose.jpg" /> </span> In this volume
of <em>Jigsaw City</em>, the true purpose of Kurg is revealed: it was
designed as a powerful weapon for fighting a war that’s as old as the
universe. The Life Giver is back, in need of Nicole and her city’s
power, while the Life Giver’s nemesis, The Void, attempts to invade the
Milky Way, to begin consuming everyone and everything there.</p>
<p><em>The Great Purpose</em> will bring the Hunter from <a
href="../ashen-blades/index.html">Ashen Blades</a> to the city, to
combat a nearly limitless supply of demons, because they’ve finally
succeeded in opening a stable portal to the galaxy. It will also involve
the Hunter’s arch-nemesis, Vogerath, since the portal was his plan.</p>

<h2 id="lost-city">Lost City</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <img
src="../../images/Cover-LostCity.jpg" /> </span> Nicole and the Hunter
may have won the battle with demon-kind and The Void, but the cost is
extremely high: Nicole sacrifices her life for the success of their
crazy suicide mission and the Hunter finally reaches the limits of both
her demon and witch powers, with disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Nicole’s body is restored by automatic functions of the City of Kurg,
but her mind is shattered by re-birth as its living avatar. Lost,
confused and alone, will Nicole ever return to her home and those she
loves or will she forever wander a dying, parallel universe, seeking a
home she can’t even remember?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Hunter is also lost and alone, but in immediate peril.
She emerges from the spatial tear formed by The Void’s final kick at
thirty-thousand feet above a strange, alien planet, with absolutely no
idea where she is. Even worse, she’s lost the power of the elements and
been left to her own devices, totally unable to fly. Will she survive
the fall and find some way to get home or will she remain forever
lost?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="the-memory-hunt">The Memory Hunt</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>Nicole discovers the fact that her memories were backed up by the
city before she was killed, but unlike her body, it was unable to fully
restore her mind.</p>
<p>Seeking to regain a greater measure of humanity, Nicole goes back to
collecting lost fragments of the City of Kurg, mostly for the sake of
restoring her memories.</p>
<p>This takes her beyond the galaxy she knows, to far-flung areas of the
multiverse, because when the ancient city broke up, parts of it left the
galaxy, while some few traveled to parallel universes.</p>
