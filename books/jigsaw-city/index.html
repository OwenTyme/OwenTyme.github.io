<h1 id="series">Jigsaw City</h1>
<p><em>Jigsaw City</em> is a sequel series to <a
href="../wizards-scion/index.html">The Wizard’s Scion</a>, centered
around the life of Levi’s daughter, Nicole Jacobs, and her quest to
reunite the pieces of a magical city that was broken up millions of
years before she was born.</p>
<h2 id="plan">Release Plan</h2>
<p>Currently, the plan is to release this series a chapter at a time, on
<a href="https://www.royalroad.com">Royal Road</a>. When each volume has
been fully posted, they’ll be published both in Ebook and print
editions, in many online stores.</p>
<p>For the time being, the Ebooks <em>will not</em> be published via
Amazon, because they have exclusivity requirements that preclude free
distribution via other channels.</p>
<p>Eventually, the versions in their original, online locations will
become short teasers, perhaps six chapters long.</p>
<p>The first chapter of volume one was published on Saturday, March 8,
2025. The rest will follow a chapter at a time, every Tuesday, Thursday
and Saturday.</p>

hexagonal coin for her twentieth birthday, but during analysis of the
strange, magic trinket, she accidentally copies the magic item’s base
spell into her mind, where it rapidly expands beyond the original
design, slowly consuming her mind from the inside! Nicole reluctantly
seeks out the maker of the item, hoping to find a cure before it’s too

barely explored region of the galaxy, war breaks out between humans that
are forced to land there and the fairies that left Earth during World
War II, because the human race had become too violent to share a planet
with.</p>
<p><em>Fey Fighters</em> introduces true fairies to the setting, who
will also be seen in volume four, where they’ll play a vital role
providing exposition and will also play a part in <em>The Great
Purpose</em>, due to the linked nature of both demons and fey.</p>

<p><span class="book-cover"> <a href="stone-prophet.html"><img
src="../../images/Cover-StoneProphet.jpg" /></a> </span> Having accepted
the fact that the City of Kurg is permanently bonded to her mind and
soul, Nicole seeks to collect all of the missing fragments of the
magical city from her home world, but the remaining pieces were
deactivated and don’t speak to her in the irritating way of those among
the stars, leaving her frustrated.</p>
<p>Just as she’s researching ways to locate them, a deactivated piece of
the city comes to life and Nicole leads the collection mission, herself.
She meets a dwarf history miner that’s just found both a piece of Kurg
and a fragment of one of the stone men that built Kurg, which whispers
into his mind.</p>
<p>The fragment turns out to be a piece of the Seventh Sage, a mad
prophet that can see the future.</p>
<p>Convinced the Sage knows where the missing pieces of Kurg are, Nicole
seeks to collect the rest of him, but the journey is perilous and Nicole
is forced to take three lives, by her own hand.</p>
<p>Worse things await her, because the Sage harbors a parasitic soul
that’s taken over: one of the most powerful necromancers that’s ever
lived. The ancient witch seeks to defeat Nicole and take her place in
the Sage’s prophesies.</p>
<p>Will Nicole win the day, or will the witch steal both her soul and
her fate?</p>
<p><em>Stone Prophet</em> brings Nicole’s adopted mother into the
series, as Nicole encounters her in the most disreputable port on the
ocean side of the planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <img
src="../../images/Cover-PrincessOfKurg.jpg" /> </span> Having collected
the fragments of the magic city of Kurg from her home planet, Nicole
turns her gaze upward, to the stars of the Milky Way, soon coming into
conflict with gun-slinging snails, aliens, the dragon she raised from an
egg, some really annoying monkeys with crossbows and even fairies.</p>
<p>Barely sleeping, due to the stress, she’s frustrated by the politics
of running a city and the endless diplomacy required to gain access to
every corner of the galaxy, but controlling her anger always was one of
her weakest points.</p>
<p>Ruling a magic, flying city was never Nicole’s dream, but with no
better alternative, her reality increasingly begins to resemble one of
her nightmares…</p>
<p>Will Nicole blow her top and possibly a few cities along the way, or
will the poor woman find peace and a little quality sleep? Will she make
the hard choices, or will the hard choices make her?</p>

<h2 id="collector-of-kurg">Collector of Kurg</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <img
src="../../images/Cover-CollectorOfKurg.jpg" /> </span></p>
<p>This is currently planned as a collection of short stories and
novellas, but they’re equally likely to become so tightly-bound
together, they’ll become novels. Each will feature a framing story and
largely focus on missions to collect pieces of Kurg, but some “at home”
stories mixed in might be good, involving Nicole dealing with the
cultural melting pot she’s created.</p>
<p>These volumes may end up feeling more like classic sci-fi than most
of my work, due to visits to many alien worlds.</p>
<p>I think I will come up with cover art for each story, mostly for
fun.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h3 id="short-story-seeds">Short Story Seeds</h3>
<ul>
<li>Integrating the fairies from volumes two and four
<ul>
<li>This would be an “at home” story</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Visiting Earth</li>
<li>Called home to Heart Forge, to help deal with a prison break
involving the trolls Nicole found in volume three</li>
<li>Daniel Malachi’s visit to Heart Forge, which was hinted at in volume
3</li>
<li>Chasing the Monkey King
<ul>
<li>Follow-up to the monkeys with crossbows</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Giant with a piece of Kurg
<ul>
<li>This would pair well with the one about shrinking technology</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hidden gas giant station run by pirates
<ul>
<li>May tie in to the Unrooted novella</li>
<li>At least belongs in the same collection</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Visiting the galactic core (high radiation and time dilation)</li>
<li><em>Kaiju Kalamity</em> would focus on defeating giant monsters in
the Eastern Coalition
<ul>
<li>This would be a fun opportunity to once again reuse the pilot of
Jetpack Samurai</li>
<li>Perhaps <em>Jigsaw City</em> needs a squad of mecha?</li>
<li>Could cover the fallout from the kaiju fight in <a
href="../wizards-scion/forgotten-legends.html">Forgotten
Legends</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This list is not quite as big as it needs to be, just yet, but these
little seeds are not so hard to come up with and most were ideas that
got cut from Pricess of Kurg, due to length. On the other hand, my
variation of a “short” story can be rather lengthy, usually four to five
chapters of content, so probably 12k-20k words.</p>
<h3 id="novella-seeds">Novella Seeds</h3>
<ul>
<li>Abandoned penal colony researching shrinking technology
<ul>
<li>Good climax for the first collection</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Jigsaw City</em> vs. the Unrooted Fleet
<ul>
<li>The Galactic core story may be a tie-in or part of this
<ul>
<li>After all, the Unrooted <em>love</em> radiation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>World Song</em> is about a world where magic made every living
thing telepathic via troll song and everything constantly sings, even
plants and microorganisms</li>
<li><em>Baga Yaga Lives!</em> (see below) may becomes a novella, instead
of a novel</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="collection-one">Collection One</h3>
<p>Collection one’s framing story will involve Nicole dealing with the
consequences of the death of a family member, playing with the ideas of
both size and consequences. The giant will be part of it and the
abandoned penal colony will be the climax.</p>
<h3 id="collection-two">Collection Two</h3>
<p>This one will be focused on pirates and skirting around the edges of
the galactic core.</p>
<p>I definitely want to involve the Unrooted, beginning and ending with
them. I think the hidden gas giant station will be one of their bases,
while the big battle between <em>Jigsaw City</em> and the Unrooted Fleet
will be the climax.</p>
<p>Something might be made of the virus that was being engineered in
volume 4.</p>
<p>I may combine the battle with the Unrooted fleet and the visit to the
galactic core, because the Unrooted <em>love</em> radiation. Perhaps the
big Unrooted flag ship flees toward the core, in an attempt to
escape?</p>
<p>Alternatively, the battle with the Unrooted will become a real
butcher shop, with the Unrooted getting their butts handed to them. That
may cause their leaders to flee toward the core, thinking to try again
in a far-flung future, using the time dilation of the block hole at the
core to their advantage. They won’t expect <em>Jigsaw City</em> to
follow.</p>
<h3 id="collections-three-may-need-a-fourth">Collections Three (May need
a Fourth)</h3>
<p>This might might focus on visiting the eastern portion of the United
Nations of the South Galaxy, as well as the Eastern Coalition, so I
should come up with some story seeds related to oriental and Slavic
cultures.</p>
<p>I’m debating making <a href="#baba-yaga-lives">Baba Yaga Lives!</a>
the climax of this collection. That would fit well with using Slavic
culture.</p>
<p>Alternatively, I may separate the oriental and Slavic bits into two
separate collections, depending on where my research takes me.</p>
<p><em>World Song</em> might work well as a piece that explores the
individualism of western cultures contrasted with the community and
family-centric views of eastern cultures, because putting the individual
last and the collective first is meant to be the focus of that story.
<em>World Song</em> may become the end of the fourth volume.</p>
<h2 id="baba-yaga-lives">Baba Yaga Lives!</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <img
src="../../images/Cover-BabaYagaLives.jpg" /> </span> Baba Yaga started
out wanting to live a little longer, falling to the temptations of
necromancy to extend her life, gaining a mere decade or so with each
human soul she consumed. Eventually growing dissatisfied with such
meager fare, she turned her attention to consuming the souls of magical
creatures for the extra power they contain and her body slowly became
more magic than flesh, transforming her into a thaumavore.</p>
<p>However, with the rise of science and magical creatures of the galaxy
growing wise to her tricks, there’s precious little for her to eat. She
can’t afford the hefty price enchanted items sell for on the galactic
market and finds their weak magic unsatisfying, anyway, but she does
come across a rare and undervalued curio: one of the hexagonal coins
that make up the magical City of Kurg, an object so impossibly filled
with magic, it has the power to resist her every attempt to consume
it!</p>
<p>She seeks to unlock the hidden power of the coin, hoping to extend
her life until the end of time with its nearly limitless magic.
Unfortunately for her, not just anyone can access the magic of Kurg,
something only a city administrator can authorize. Learning this fact by
touching the mind of the coin, she seeks a conversation with Nicole, who
happens to be an administrator.</p>
<p>Nicole’s quest to collect the missing pieces of the City of Kurg
brings her right to Baba Yaga’s doorstep, but since their goals are
nothing alike and totally at odds, the meeting devolves into a magical
duel! War for ownership of the city follows, eventually leading to a
sprawling battle inside the legendary chicken-legged hut of Baba Yaga, a
magically-folded, mind-bending space that would give even M. C. Escher a
headache!</p>
Will Nicole overcome the crone’s superior, time-tested spells or will
Nicole, as an extension of Kurg, become Baba Yaga’s living larder?
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Baba Yaga Lives!</em> will bring legendary magical creatures to
the city, including Levi’s old familiar, Inorath, because Nicole will
need information on Baba Yaga and many of them are even older than the
ancient witch.</p>
<h2 id="the-great-purpose">The Great Purpose</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <img
src="../../images/Cover-TheGreatPurpose.jpg" /> </span> <em>The Great
Purpose</em> will start with a visit to the planet Neo York and the
Hunter from <a href="../ashen-blades/index.html">Ashen Blades</a> will
somehow end up in <em>Jigsaw City</em>. That will initially lead
directly to a nasty fight between Nicole and the Hunter, because she’s
seen Nicole’s dragon before, back when the beast was a demon.</p>
<p>Just as they’re working out the details of pecking order, one of the
most dangerous demons in existence will arrive in <em>Jigsaw City</em>
and the two heroines will be forced to work together, along with the
Queen of the Fairies, because the Hunter doesn’t know the city or the
demon in question and Nicole doesn’t know much at all about demons, in
general.</p>
<p>The demon is the corrupt, original version of Nicole’s aunt and she
has one goal in mind: killing Nicole’s birth mother, Lyra. She considers
it her pleasure to cut a bloody swath through both <em>Jigsaw City</em>
and Nicole to get what she wants.</p>
<p>The novel will culminate in the demons finally opening a stable
portal to the Milky Way, out of which star ships of a demonic design
will surge. That’s an emergency like no other the Milky Way has faced
before, leading to a clash between two whole galaxies, with the freedom
of the entire multiverse at stake.</p>
<p>Every faction of the Milky Way will come together to fight for their
right to survive, including the Northwestern Empire, the UNSG, the EC,
Heart Forge, the <em>Jigsaw City</em> fleet and the legends, including
all the gods and monsters that humanity has ever believed in,
particularly the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>The various fairy queens of each fey species will give their power to
their chosen representative, unifying their royal power in a Queen with
the might of the ages. This is likely to be a fairy of Unseelie origin,
allowing the ancient power of the Unseelie and Seelie Queens to rest on
the same shoulders.</p>
<p>The Hunter will take the last of the elemental spirits into her body,
which is the Life Spirit/Life Giver and she’ll aim to fight The Void,
face to face, to put a final end to the war between humanity and the
demons.</p>
<p>The battle with the demon fleet will be a vicious one, with
<em>Jigsaw City</em> leading the charge, in an attempt to force their
way through the portal, to stem the tide of evil from the other
side.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="lost-city">Lost City</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <img
src="../../images/Cover-LostCity.jpg" /> </span> Nicole and the Hunter
may have won the battle with demon-kind and The Void, but the cost is
extremely high: Nicole sacrificed her life for the success of their
crazy suicide mission and the Hunter finally reached the limits of both
her demon and witch powers, with disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Nicole’s body is restored by automatic functions of the City of Kurg,
but her mind is shattered by her re-birth as its living avatar. Lost,
confused and alone, will Nicole ever return to her home and those she
loves or will she forever wander a dying, parallel universe, seeking a
home she can’t even remember?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Hunter is also lost and alone, but in immediate peril.
She emerges from the spatial tear formed by The Void’s final kick at
thirty-thousand feet above a strange, alien planet, with absolutely no
idea where she is. Even worse, she’s lost the power of the elements and
been left to her own devices, totally unable to fly. Will she survive
the fall and find some way to get home or will she remain forever
lost?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="the-memory-hunt">The Memory Hunt</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>Nicole discovers the fact that her memories were backed up by the
city before she was killed, but unlike her body, it was unable to fully
restore her mind.</p>
<p>Seeking to regain a greater measure of humanity, Nicole goes back to
collecting lost fragments of the City of Kurg, mostly for the sake of
restoring her memories.</p>
<p>This takes her beyond the galaxy she knows, to far-flung areas of the
multiverse, because when the ancient city broke up, parts of it left the
galaxy, while some few traveled to parallel universes.</p>
