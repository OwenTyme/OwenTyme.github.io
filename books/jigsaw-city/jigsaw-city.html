unsure what direction to take in life, because the opportunities
available to her are too numerous and no one job fits all of her
talents, but she passes the time doing research on dragons. To that end,
she hatches a dragon egg, but in the midst of the harrowing work
required, she dreams of the ancient, magical City of Kurg, which yearns
to be whole.</p>
<p>She soon discovers, based on a chance encounter with a small magic
item she’d been analyzing, that her mind has been dangerously
intertwined with that of the city, which spreads through her brain like
a disease, slowly taking over. At first, she’s able to keep it under
control by suppressing magic within her own head, but over time, it
begins breaking past the road blocks she desperately erects in its path
as it inches toward total control.</p>
<p>Seeking a cure, she’s forced to research the ancient city, while the
clock ticks down on her sanity and ultimately, her life. Meeting the
strange, stone men that made the city, the Ulkun, she finds they have
few answers for her, but suggest that if she locates the Architect of
Kurg, one of their own kind, he might be of some help. Unfortunately,
due to the fact he was trapped inside a small segment of the sealed city
for millions of years, alone, he’s quite insane, unhelpful and worse,
eventually becomes hostile, forming a plan for galactic domination.</p>
<p>Instead, Nicole seeks the Life Giver, the mysterious being that
created the Ulkun and ordered the construction of Kurg, while collecting
pieces of the city, in the hopes of attracting their attention.</p>
Will Nicole find a cure, freeing herself from the clutches of Kurg, or
will she lose control of her own mind, taken over by the magic city?
Will the Architect succeed at replacing everyone in the galaxy with
obedient, magically-animated drones with no will of their own or will
Nicole stop him?
