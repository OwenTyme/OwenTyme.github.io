The series starts with volume one, titled [Sky Children](sky-children.html), in which Zechariah crash lands on an 'unexplored' planet, only to uncover a terrifying government conspiracy to hide the existence of the Mind Fire virus, which grants magic powers to those infected by it.

Even worse, the intelligence people will do just about anything to hide the truth, including nuking their own colonies, from orbit.  In point of fact, such a tragedy once happened on Zechariah's new home world, using the guise of a quarantine to corral the witnesses, for extermination.

Learning these facts, Zechariah vows to do something about it and eventually, when he and his friends find a buried star ship, they force that revelation on the entire empire he left behind, because the people have a right to know.
