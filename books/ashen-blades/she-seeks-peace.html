<p><em>She Seeks Peace</em> is book four of <a href="index.html">Ashen
Blades</a>, which centers on the adventures of a half-demon girl (the
Hunter) and her friends in an ancient order of demon hunters (The Order
of Ash and Smoke, also known as Ashen Blades).</p>
<p><em>She Seeks Peace</em> releases January 10th, 2024.</p>

all the Hunter wanted, but between old enemies with agendas of their
own, angry elemental spirits and her own friends never quite knowing
when to leave her be, that elusive moment of quiet contemplation is
always just out of reach.</p>
<p>The Hunter’s journey began with the loss of her best friend, the only
man that was ever a father figure to her, which reminds her of losing
the first real friend she ever had, because the two private detectives
had much in common and the similarities compound her grief.</p>
<p>She walks the surface of the Moon, for what better place could there
be to seek a quiet moment? Unfortunately, she soon faces an unexpected
demon that’s been trapped there for thousands of years. Next, she tries
a remote valley watched over by an ally, but the lonely woman pesters
the Hunter until she loses her temper and is forced to leave.</p>
<p>She wanders many remote and unusual corners of the world, always in
search of that moment of solitude, that she might reflect on the past,
but the arch-demon known as Wrath has taken a liking to her, and seeks
her hand in marriage. To that end, he posts a bounty for her capture and
the path to emotional healing becomes a frustrating battlefield.</p>
<p>She seeks the mythic last of all sanctuaries, but instead finds a
half-demon girl much like herself, and a quest to help the lonely child
connect with family.</p>
In the midst of the Hunter’s busy and frenetic life, will she find a
moment to grieve her two best friends and learn to move on, or will all
of creation forever stand in the way?

<h2 id="looking-for-more">Looking For More?</h2>
<p>The next book in <a href="index.html">Ashen Blades</a> hasn’t been
written yet.</p>
<p>Currently, my plans for the next installment of this series have not
yet been set and are completely up in the air regarding both which novel
is next and even the title of the most likely option.</p>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <a
href="index.html#she-hunts-gluttony"><img
src="../../images/Cover-SheHuntsGluttony.jpg" /></a> </span></p>
<p>The next book will probably be <a
href="../../books.html#she-hunts-gluttony">She Hunts Gluttony</a>, but
that’s just a working title and the plot needs more thought before I can
write it.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p><span class="book-cover-right"> <a
href="index.html#she-hunts-witches"><img
src="../../images/Cover-SheHuntsWitches.jpg" /></a> </span></p>
<p>On the other hand, I have the plot for <a
href="index.html#she-hunts-witches">She Hunts Witches</a> mostly worked
out in my head, but the trouble with this one is that I’m not sure how
to research Japan properly, to write it, because I want that to be the
setting. Ideally, I’d like to go there for a research trip, but I can’t
afford that. The next best alternative is interviewing someone that has
spent time there, but I don’t know anyone that has.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <a
href="index.html#she-hunts-gremlins"><img
src="../../images/Cover-SheHuntsGremlins.jpg" /></a> </span></p>
<p>The last option is <a href="index.html#she-hunts-gremlins">She Hunts
Gremlins</a>, for which I have very strong plot idea, but the trouble
is, I prefer this one to come after the other two, because the novel
will have far-reaching consequences to my fictional version of
Earth.</p>
