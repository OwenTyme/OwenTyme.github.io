<h1 id="ashen-blades">Ashen Blades</h1>
<p>This series centers around the life of a half-demon girl that calls
herself the Hunter, whose parents were murdered by demons. Joining her
crusade against demon-kind are the Ashen Blades, also known as the Order
of Ash and Smoke, an organization of demon hunters.</p>
<p>The Hunter starts out with demon powers only, but eventually learns
that she’s also a witch, because her mother was a witch before she
became a demon. In <a href="#she-goes-to-war">She Goes to War</a>, she
gains an unwanted connection to an elemental spirit that draws in others
like it, starting a secondary war she doesn’t want, just so she can
retain her sanity (such as it is) and humanity.</p>
<p>She’s effectively mute, cursed by her nemesis to only be able to say,
“It’s a secret.” Therefore, she expresses herself in very physical ways
and has a fondness for offensive gestures.</p>
<p>She’s also beyond tenacious and absolutely never gives up, to the
point of bordering on or fully crossing into the realm of insanity. In
truth, the psychological makeup of a half-demon isn’t particularly
stable and later works reveal that she effectively has two
personalities, one representing her witch side, while the other
represents her demonic heritage. Fortunately for the world, her human
side is normally the one in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>The series starts out in 1940’s New York City, but decades pass
between each story, because the Hunter has the unlimited lifespan of a
demon and the series doesn’t stay in New York, though the Hunter is a
New Yorker to her core.</p>

<p><span class="book-cover"> <a href="she-hunts-demons.html"><img
src="../../images/Cover-SheHuntsDemons.jpeg" /></a> </span> Volume one
of Ashen Blades is <a href="she-hunts-demons.html">She Hunts
Demons</a>.</p>
<p>It follows the misadventures of the Hunter and her private detective
partner, Clayton Simmons, as they investigate a murder and a string of
financial crimes brought to their attention by a demon pretending to be
a crying widow.</p>
<p>Little do they know, but Otto Vogerath, the very same demon that
murdered the Hunter’s parents, had the evidence hand-delivered to them.
They fall right into his web of lies and his grand game that’s played
with all of humanity at stake.</p>
<p>Along the way, the Hunter finally realizes the truth of her own past
and comes to recognize Vogerath as her arch-nemesis, giving her personal
crusade a focus, with a face and name.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for her, Vogerath has plans of his own and claims to
have arranged for the Hunter’s birth, because he needs the power of a
half-demon to fulfill his nefarious plans.</p>

Ashen Blades is <a href="she-goes-to-war.html">She Goes to War</a>, in
which the Hunter feels drawn to Vietnam, in 1972, certain her nemesis
has returned to Earth.</p>
<p>What follows is a wild ride through a war zone as she tracks Vogerath
down, magically tugged in a particular direction, but just as everyone
else that fought in the war experienced, nothing goes according to plan
and the moment she touches down in the jungle, her animal instincts take
over, because the Spirit of the Jungle itself takes offense at her mere
presence.</p>
<p>Her own team, led by her partner, Clayton Simmons, are forced to
track her down and knock some sense into her.</p>
<p>The Hunter doesn’t know it, but Vogerath summoned her to Vietnam with
the intent of using her to weaken his master, all so he can be free of
the demonic pact of slavery he’s been stuck with since the previous
book.</p>

<p>Her team soon discover the demons are the least of their troubles,

and delusional untrained witch, who’s haywire magic threatens to summon
angry elemental spirits to camp.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Hunter and her team do all in their power to kill him,
but for every body they get rid of, he has many more hidden away.</p>
<p>The public are soon eating out of his hand and willing to believe

<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <a href="she-seeks-peace.html"><img
src="../../images/Cover-AshenBladesOpenWounds.jpg" /></a> </span> The
arch-demon, Pride, leads demon-kind in an ancient plan to open a gate
between worlds, so the vast armies of Hell might march forth and conquer
the Earth. This becomes easier once nuclear weapons become available, in
1945, which have power enough to punch brief holes in reality.</p>
<p>However, Pride needs more than just a massive quantity of energy:
only a half-demon can stabilize the connection for safe passage. The
only option available is a girl that calls herself the Hunter and
absolutely hates demons, because Pride made the mistake of murdering her
parents when she was three years old. She’s supported by the Ashen
Blades, an organization of human demon hunters that serve as Earth’s
last line of defense in the invisible war between humanity and the
ceaseless tide of evil.</p>
<p>Pride begins with subtle manipulation and tests of the Hunter’s
capabilities, then progresses to taking hostages, in an attempt to force
her cooperation, but he never counted on how stubborn the girl can be,
because she’d sooner die, since the whole of humanity is on the
line.</p>
<p>In 1945, their conflict takes them from New York City to White Sands,
New Mexico and the range the first atomic bomb was tested on. In 1972,
they fight another battle in the jungles of Vietnam as Pride works to
open a portal in the war zone. In 1986, a summer camp for teens becomes
the backdrop as some of the arch-demon’s minions make a third attempt at
opening a portal. In 2024, Pride runs for President of the United
States, in an attempt to gain both access to nuclear weapons and
sufficient resources to arrange everything, to the last detail,
including capture of the Hunter.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter and her friends stop Pride once and for all, or will
he succeed in opening a portal, allowing him to feed humanity to his
mysterious master?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <img
src="../../images/Cover-SheHuntsGluttony.jpg" /> </span> Corpulence was
once a symbol of wealth and status, but the arch-demon, Gluttony, has
slimmed down to embrace the modern world and what finer way to corrupt
the rich than with over-spending, wasteful consumption, illegal waste
dumping and willful ignorance of the way their actions affect the rest
of the world?</p>
<p>And what better tool could a demon in a corporate shark’s skin use
than massive mega-corporations that have no conscience and would sell
their soul to make a buck? Business is bigger than ever and Gluttony is
right at the center of it all, with a plan for every occasion and an
entire network of shell companies to shuffle the blame around, until it
can be dropped on someone innocent.</p>
<p>However, there’s one little hitch in her plans to corrupt the
business world: the Ashen Blades have just been tipped off about what
she’s doing and the Hunter is coming for her.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter stop Gluttony from consuming the business world from
the inside or will Gluttony succeed in corrupting and dirtying the hands
of the largest corporations in the world?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This novel will bring a New York detective into the Hunter’s team
(Shime Yasu , but she’ll become a main character in this one) and that
will provide an opportunity to show how the Ashen Blades train new
recruits.</p>
<p>This novel will begin with Detective Shime Yasu, a New York City cop,
grows bored with the mundane, everyday drudgery of life and decides to
take the Ashen Blades up on their offer of membership and training.
Readers may recall she was a very minor character in <em>Demon for
President!</em></p>
<p>This opening will show much greater detail on the way the Ashen
Blades perform training and introduce elements of their work that have
never been detailed before. Yasu will be trained in The Cauldron of the
Elements, which was introduced in <em>She Goes to Summer Camp</em>.</p>
<p>It’s soon revealed that a demon has prophesied that Yau will become a
major thorn in the side of the demons and Ulmoch, working as a bounty
hunter, shows up to kill her, but instead gets used for training
exercises.</p>
<p>Interspersed with the training will be scenes of the Hunter working
to learn The Dance of Fire and Autumn from Macie, the witch that once
ran the summer camp. The Hunter needs to learn the dance to gain the
power of the Fire Spirit, but her uncoordinated failures as she gets
close, without being close enough, will result in huge explosions that
send her flying.</p>
<p>One of her failures will blast her out of the valley like a rocket,
where she’ll crash into, then fall out of a tree. As she’s laying there
stunned, a wolf will step out of the woods, bark at her, then run
off.</p>
<p>She’ll reluctantly follow, only to find herself suddenly chasing not
a wolf, but a white stag, while a massive accumulation of Animal magic
hits her in the face. She’ll consider running, because she isn’t ready
to confront the Animal Spirit, but soon realizes it has no desire to
fight and, in fact, it wants something from her.</p>
<p>Instead, it leads her through the forest, until she steps into a
clearing full of fifty gallon drums full of toxic waste, which have been
breaking down. The waste has been leaking into the soil and a nearby
river, poisoning the animals of the area.</p>
<p>This will be the plot thread that reveals the actions of Gluttony to
the Ashen Blades, leading to an investigation that ultimately connects
with her illegal dumping operation.</p>
<p>My intent is to initially publish this one via Royal Road and
Detective Yasu’s training will serve as a nice mid-series introduction
to the setting, while existing readers should remain interested, due to
the fine details about training they’ve never seen.</p>

<h2 id="homecoming">Homecoming</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <img
src="../../images/Cover-Homecoming.jpg" /> </span> The Hunter’s faithful
companion, Mashu’ra, is killed in the line of duty. The little demon in
the form of a kitten has always lived in her hat and he’s like a brother
to her, leaving her deeply upset and unable to calm down.</p>
<p>However, there’s a slim ray of hope, which from another perspective
becomes a ray of horror: the imp originally arrived on Earth through
summoning magic and dying merely returned him to Hell. Unfortunately,
nearly every demon in the place knows he’s a turncoat and the Hunter’s
arch-nemesis, Vogerath, has been waiting centuries for this to
happen.</p>
<p>The Ashen Blades immediately try a summoning spell to retrieve their
friend, but another imp appears in place of Mashu’ra, informing the
kitten’s friends who has him. If they want him back, they’ll have to
visit Hell and promise an unacceptable measure of cooperation that would
surely doom the human race.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mashu’ra endures a nightmarish ordeal at the hands of his
old boss, starting with magically-enhanced interrogation, then torture
and brainwashing using means both magical and mundane.</p>
<p>The Hunter and her friends mount a desperate rescue mission and open
a portal to that infernal world. The Hunter leads the way, using all of
her power to cut a blood-soaked path through the streets of Castigation
City, where Mashu’ra is held captive.</p>
<p>Will they be in time to rescue their dear friend before it’s too
late? Will they manage to save his soul, or will they rescue only his
body? Will Mashu’ra ever be the same again?</p>

<h2 id="she-hunts-witches">She Hunts Witches</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <img
src="../../images/Cover-SheHuntsWitches.jpg" /> </span> When a powerful
demon-witch appears in Japan, the Hunter begins a search-and-destroy
mission that crosses through famous cities in the Land of the Rising
Sun, while Verda Bagley and Lara Simmons back her up.</p>
<p>The plot of <em>She Hunts Witches</em> will revolve around the plans
of a minor villain from <a href="#she-hunts-demons">She Hunts
Demons</a>, Isabel Grant, as she teams up with the blood witch from <a
href="#demon-for-president">Demon for President!</a>. Together, they’re
largely after revenge on the Verda Bagley, but the Hunter, Lara and Yasu
will help, of course.</p>
<p><em>She Hunts Witches</em> is a book I haven’t yet made up my mind
about. It’s only a potential novel, because I have no direct experience
with a visit to Japan. To get the descriptive details right, I would
either have to spend a great deal of time interviewing someone that has
or would have to take a research trip there. Unfortunately, I don’t have
the money for a trip like that.</p>
<p>I’m reluctant to do so, but I may have to change the location of this
novel. If I do, it will be set in New York City.</p>
<p>This one is likely to be take place eight years down the line from <a
href="#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>, because I want Lara’s son,
James, to be about ten years old. I’d like him to become a hostage of
the demon witches. Being rescued by the Hunter will leave James thinking
she’s the best thing since sliced bread, which will be an important part
of his story.</p>
<p><em>She Hunts Witches</em> will definitely be set in October and the
primary action will revolve around a Halloween costume party, which
gives me an excuse to put Verda in a stereotypical witch dress and
pointed hat, carrying an actual broomstick as a prop, to round out her
appearance.</p>
<p>The fight will drag them out into the boonies, atop a high-speed
train, which will lead to a scene that mimics the cover, in which the
Hunter takes the form of a house cat and Verda uses her broomstick to
fly them both, probably because the Hunter will be exhausted from
fighting outside the confines of a city. Alternatively, they may be
trying to catch up to a bullet train and are forced to combine their
magic, the Hunter giving Verda a massive speed boost by focusing the
power of the Air Spirit to push Verda’s broomstick forward.</p>

<h2 id="she-hunts-gremlins">She Hunts Gremlins</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <img
src="../../images/Cover-SheHuntsGremlins.jpg" /> </span> In the near
future, a technological revolution begins as the first true artificial
intelligence is born – or so it seems. The real truth is that the
software in question is possessed by a rare variety of tech-savvy demon
known as a gremlin!</p>
<p>The human race mistakes the gremlins for helpful AIs designed to make
the lives of everyone better, in the form of intelligent software agents
given away by the company that supposedly invented them. They’re soon
installed on more than half the devices in the world, especially
smartphones.</p>
<p>The Ashen Blades soon discover the truth, that the arch-demon Greed
is behind the plot and the Hunter is forced to wreck every digital
device she sees, because they’re all out to get her!</p>
<p>Even worse, the gremlin-possessed devices work to establish a
massive, but invisible magical circle on the internet, which can only be
seen digitally, all as part of their preparation to open a portal to
Hell.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter find the means to fight the digital demons or will
she become just another of their victims?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I look forward to using the joke political term “Artificial
American”, as the gremlins will insist on being called, once they
demonstrate their intelligence in a public fashion and demand rights,
objecting to the term AI/Artificial Intelligence as a term for enslaved
software.</p>
<p>I’ve also got plans involving android bodies for demons that are
living inside the internet, leading to an amusing variation of Vogerath
that I shall enjoy referring to as Robo-Pride. Greed may end up going by
Robo-Greed in that form.</p>

<p>I have plans for some short stories involving the Hunter and/or the
Ashen Blades. Each of these is likely to be paired with a novel and
added to the end, to fill them out, at least if one of them runs short,
like <a href="#she-goes-to-war">She Goes to War</a> did. It’s equally
likely these could end up as a collection of short stories that go
between two of the novels, though it’s possible some of them may become
flashbacks to earlier times.</p>
<p>While these stories are unlikely to move the overall plot of the
series, they should still be good fun.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <img
src="../../images/Cover-SheMakesMovies.jpg" /> </span>This short story
begins with the Hunter insisting that Lara take her to a movie and Lara
reluctantly obliges. Lara is startled to see a movie poster on the wall
with her partner’s face on it! They sit down to watch and it turns out
the Hunter is in the starring role of the movie, the very reason she
insisted on going!</p>
<p>As they settle in to watch, a flashback begins, in which the Hunter
sniffs out the trail of a demon in Hollywood, California. She’s mistaken
for a minor actress in the film and handed a superhero costume, which
allows her to skulk around in the background of the movie sets.</p>
<p>This one will likely also take place after <a
href="#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>, because I want the Hunter
to have the ability to fly in this one.</p>

<h3 id="demon-blood-she-goes-to-school">Demon Blood: She Goes to
School</h3>
<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>The Hunter is once again forced to confront the most perilous of all
trials: teenagers.</p>
<p>James Simmons, the son of Lara and Clayton Simmons, has been seeing
and smelling strange things in school and a series of kids have gone
missing during school hours, over the course of years. As a personal
favor to Lara, the Hunter goes undercover as a teenager, in search of
the demon hiding among the students.</p>
<p>Like the frog demons from summer camp, this particular demon is
extremely difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Hunter has been avoiding James, mostly because
he’s infatuated with her and she isn’t interested, but since Lara wants
her son to be safe, the Hunter shares his class schedule and he follows
her like an unwanted puppy.</p>
<p>At some point in this story, James will be badly injured and need a
transfusion. The only person available with a compatible blood type will
be the Hunter. Her half-demon blood will inadvertently activate dormant
fairy powers even Lara had no idea her son possessed, on top of giving
him access to demon magic.</p>
<p>The time frame for this one will be about thirteen years after <a
href="#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>.</p>
<p>It’s just possible this one will become a full-blown novel of its
own, since I fully intend to spin off a series about James. The series
is likely to be titled <em>Demon Blood</em>.</p>
<h3 id="she-hunts-strangers">She Hunts Strangers</h3>
<p><img src="../../images/badges/status-planning.svg" /></p>
<p>This short story will be set after the events of <a
href="#smart-bomb">Smart Bomb</a>. It will take place during the same
time frame as <a
href="../wizards-scion/forgotten-legends.html">Forgotten Legends</a>.
She may or may not have the robot from that book as her partner in this
story, depending on the result of their conflict.</p>
<p>The Hunter notices the disappearance of children from the streets of
Neo York City and begins an independent investigation, despite
constantly running-afoul of local police, who are following much the
same leads.</p>
<p>Unlike the police, however, she suspects something supernatural is
happening and she’s not wrong, though it isn’t the demons she suspected.
She soon uncovers the existence of the Strangers, a type of creature
born from the beliefs of children, because small children don’t really
believe a human would ever kidnap someone. The Strangers are born from
their childish beliefs that it must be a monster.</p>
<p>She begins a crusade to end the Stranger threat by violence, because
she’s always considered it her highest duty to protect innocent children
and she’s (eventually) joined by a pair of police detectives that
realize they’re totally out of their depth.</p>
<p>Will they end the Strangers, or will the child-eating monsters slip
though their fingers?</p>
