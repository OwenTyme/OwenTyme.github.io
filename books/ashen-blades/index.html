<h1 id="ashen-blades">Ashen Blades</h1>
<p>This series centers around the life of a half-demon girl that calls
herself the Hunter, whose parents were murdered by demons. Joining her
crusade against demon-kind are the Ashen Blades, also known as the Order
of Ash and Smoke, an organization of demon hunters.</p>
<p>The Hunter starts out with demon powers only, but eventually learns
that she’s also a witch, because her mother was a witch before she
became a demon. In <a href="#she-goes-to-war">She Goes to War</a>, she
gains an unwanted connection to an elemental spirit that draws in others
like it, starting a secondary war she doesn’t want, just so she can
retain her sanity (such as it is) and humanity.</p>
<p>She’s effectively mute, cursed by her nemesis to only be able to say,
“It’s a secret.” Therefore, she expresses herself in very physical ways
and has a fondness for offensive gestures.</p>
<p>She’s also beyond tenacious and absolutely never gives up, to the
point of bordering on or fully crossing into the realm of insanity. In
truth, the psychological makeup of a half-demon isn’t particularly
stable and later works reveal that she effectively has two
personalities, one representing her witch side, while the other
represents her demonic heritage. Fortunately for the world, her human
side is normally the one in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>The series starts out in 1940’s New York City, but decades pass
between each story, because the Hunter has the unlimited lifespan of a
demon and the series doesn’t stay in New York, though the Hunter is a
New Yorker to her core.</p>
<h2 id="she-hunts-demons"><a href="she-hunts-demons.html">She Hunts
Demons</a></h2>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <a href="she-hunts-demons.html"><img
src="../../images/Cover-SheHuntsDemons.jpeg" /></a> </span> Volume one
of Ashen Blades is <a href="she-hunts-demons.html">She Hunts
Demons</a>.</p>
<p>It follows the misadventures of the Hunter and her private detective
partner, Clayton Simmons, as they investigate a murder and a string of
financial crimes brought to their attention by a demon pretending to be
a crying widow.</p>
<p>Little do they know, but Otto Vogerath, the very same demon that
murdered the Hunter’s parents, had the evidence hand-delivered to them.
They fall right into his web of lies and his grand game that’s played
with all of humanity at stake.</p>
<p>Along the way, the Hunter finally realizes the truth of her own past
and comes to recognize Vogerath as her arch-nemesis, giving her personal
crusade a focus, with a face and name.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for her, Vogerath has plans of his own and claims to
have arranged for the Hunter’s birth, because he needs the power of a
half-demon to fulfill his nefarious plans.</p>

War</a></h2>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <a href="she-goes-to-war.html"><img
src="../../images/Cover-SheGoesToWar.jpg" /></a> </span> Volume two of
Ashen Blades is <a href="she-goes-to-war.html">She Goes to War</a>, in
which the Hunter feels drawn to Vietnam, in 1972, certain her nemesis
has returned to Earth.</p>
<p>What follows is a wild ride through a war zone as she tracks Vogerath
down, magically tugged in a particular direction, but just as everyone
else that fought in the war experienced, nothing goes according to plan
and the moment she touches down in the jungle, her animal instincts take
over, because the Spirit of the Jungle itself takes offense at her mere
presence.</p>
<p>Her own team, led by her partner, Clayton Simmons, are forced to
track her down and knock some sense into her.</p>
<p>The Hunter doesn’t know it, but Vogerath summoned her to Vietnam with
the intent of using her to weaken his master, all so he can be free of
the demonic pact of slavery he’s been stuck with since the previous
book.</p>

three of Ashen Blades is <a href="demon-for-president.html">Demon for

to charm just about anyone that senses him, so long as they’re willing
to at least listen.</p>
<p>He runs for President of the United States on the 2024 ticket, first
as a Republican and then also as a Democrat, using his demonic power to
be in many places at once to convince the American public he’s a pair of
brothers.</p>
<p>Naturally, the Hunter and her team do all in their power to kill him,
but for every body they get rid of, he has many more hidden away.</p>
<p>The public are soon eating out of his hand and willing to believe
anything he says, because the magic he pumps out through television
broadcasts leaves them susceptible to his every suggestion.</p>

visits many remote places for some clarity via quiet solitude for deep

<h2 id="she-hunts-gluttony">She Hunts Gluttony (Working Title)</h2>
<p>Corpulence was once a symbol of wealth and status, but the
arch-demon, Gluttony, has slimmed down to embrace the modern world and
what finer way to corrupt the rich than with over-spending, wasteful
consumption, illegal waste dumping and willful ignorance of the way
their actions affect the rest of the world?</p>
<p>And what better tool could a demon in a corporate shark’s skin use
than massive mega-corporations that have no conscience and would sell
their soul to make a buck? Business is bigger than ever and Gluttony is
right at the center of it all, with a plan for every occasion and an
entire network of shell companies to shuffle the blame around, until it
can be dropped on someone innocent.</p>
<p>However, there’s one little hitch in her plans to corrupt the
business world: the Ashen Blades have just been tipped off about what
she’s doing and the Hunter is coming for her.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter stop Gluttony from consuming the business world from
the inside or will Gluttony succeed in corrupting and dirtying the hands
of the largest corporations in the world?</p>

<h2 id="she-hunts-gremlins">She Hunts Gremlins</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <img
src="../../images/Cover-SheHuntsGremlins.jpg" /> </span></p>
<p>In the near future, a technological revolution begins as the first
true artificial intelligence is born – or so it seems. The real truth is
that the software in question is possessed by a rare variety of
tech-savvy demon known as a gremlin!</p>
<p>The human race mistakes the gremlins for helpful AIs designed to make
the lives of everyone better, in the form of intelligent software agents
given away by the company that supposedly invented them. They’re soon
installed on more than half the devices in the world, especially
smartphones.</p>
<p>The Ashen Blades soon discover the truth, that the arch-demon Greed
is behind the plot and the Hunter is forced to wreck every digital
device she sees, because they’re all out to get her!</p>
<p>Even worse, the gremlin-possessed devices work to establish a
massive, but invisible magical circle on the internet, which can only be
seen digitally, all as part of their preparation to open a portal to
Hell.</p>
Will the Hunter find the means to fight the digital demons or will she
become just another of their victims?

<h2 id="she-hunts-witches">She Hunts Witches</h2>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <img
src="../../images/Cover-SheHuntsWitches.jpg" /> </span> When a powerful
demon-witch appears in Japan, the Hunter begins a search-and-destroy
mission that crosses through famous cities in the Land of the Rising
Sun, while Verda Bagley and Lara Simmons back her up.</p>
<p>The plot of <em>She Hunts Witches</em> will revolve around the plans
of a minor villain from <a href="#she-hunts-demons">She Hunts Demons</a>
as she teams up with the blood witch from <a
href="#demon-for-president">Demon for President!</a>. Together, they’re
largely after revenge on the Hunter and her friends.</p>
<p><em>She Hunts Witches</em> is a book I haven’t yet made up my mind
about. It’s only a potential novel, because I have no direct experience
with a visit to Japan. To get the descriptive details right, I would
either have to spend a great deal of time interviewing someone that has
or would have to take a research trip there. Unfortunately, I don’t have
the money for a trip like that.</p>
<p>I’m reluctant to do so, but I may have to change the location of this
novel.</p>
<p>This one is likely to be set eight years down the line from <a
href="#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>, because I want Lara’s son,
James, to be about ten years old. I’d like him to become a hostage of
the demon witches. Being rescued by the Hunter will leave James thinking
the she’s the best thing since sliced bread.</p>

<h2 id="she-protects-eden">She Protects Eden</h2>
<p>When the long-lost descendants of the ten tribes of Israel return
from the stars in the year 2502 A.D., offering their cousins on Earth
the chance to colonize space, the Hunter stows away on one of the colony
ships, in pursuit of a demon that seeks to spoil a new Garden of Eden,
before it’s even constructed.</p>
<p>The arch-demon Sloth seeks to forcefully implant demons in the
sleeping mind of every colonist during the decades long voyage between
stars, to produce an entire colony of demons.</p>
<p>Will the Hunter stop Sloth or will the demons gain a significant
foothold in the galaxy?</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="smart-bomb">Smart Bomb</h2>
<p>Having obtained an illegal level of intelligence, comparable to that
of a human, a robot seeks to hide and survive on the streets of Neo York
City on the planet Neo York, deep within United Nations of the South
Galaxy territory.</p>
<p>While on the run, it stumbles across a plot to develop a dangerous,
new weapon: a hand-held anti-matter explosive. Acting on a deep, moral
imperative, the robot decides to do something about it.</p>
<p>However, the robot isn’t the only one on the trail, stumbling into
the Hunter, who’s out to kill the demon-scientist developing the bomb
for the purpose of opening a portal to the home of demon-kind. Will they
team up or tear each other apart?</p>
<p>This novel will be set about 300 years before the time of Zechariah
Jacobs and the events of <a href="../sky-children/index.html">Sky
Children</a>.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="short-stories">Short Stories</h2>
<p>I have plans for some short stories involving the Hunter and/or the
Ashen Blades. Each of these is likely to be paired with a novel and
added to the end, to fill them out, at least if one of them runs short,
like <a href="#she-goes-to-war">She Goes to War</a> did. It’s equally
likely these could end up as a collection of short stories that go
between two of the novels, though it’s possible some of them may become
flashbacks to earlier times.</p>
<p>While these stories are unlikely to move the overall plot of thge
series, they should still be good fun.</p>
<h3 id="the-new-recruit">The New Recruit</h3>
<p>In this short story, Detective Shime Yasu, a New York City cop, grows
bored with the mundane, everyday drudgery of life and decides to take
the Ashen Blades up on their offer of membership and training.</p>
<p>She locates the card she was given, calls the number and makes
contact. She’s assigned Lara Simmons as her trainer and that necessarily
also involves the Hunter lending a hand, since the two of them are
partners.</p>
<p>On the first day of training, it turns out that every one of the
trainees brought weapons from home, based on superstition and
misconception, including the detective.</p>
<p>To disabuse the trainees of their incorrect notions, the Hunter
captures the infamous squirrel-demon, Ulmoch, and every one of the
strange and amusing items the trainees brought is tested on him, to
demonstrates what does and doesn’t work.</p>
<p>This has to take place after <a href="#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks
Peace</a>, since it’s based on the detective from <a
href="#demon-for-president">Demon for President!</a> and there was no
time skip between those two novels.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h3 id="she-makes-movies">She Makes Movies</h3>
<p>This short story begins with the Hunter insisting that Lara take her
to a movie and Lara reluctantly obliges. Lara is startled to see a move
poster on the wall with her partner’s face on it! They sit down to watch
and it turns out the Hunter is in the starring role of the movie, the
very reason she insisted on going to the movie!</p>
<p>As they settle in to watch, a flashback begins, in which the Hunter
sniffs out the trail of a demon in Hollywood, California. She’s mistaken
for a minor actress in the film and handed a superhero costume, which
allows her to skulk around in the background of the movie sets.</p>
<p>This one will likely also take place after <a
href="#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>, because I want the Hunter
to have the ability to fly in this one.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h3 id="demon-blood-she-goes-to-shool">Demon Blood: She Goes to
Shool</h3>
<p>The Hunter is once again forced to confront the most perilous of all
trials: teenagers.</p>
<p>James Simmons, the son of Lara and Clayton Simmons, has been seeing
and smelling strange things in school and a series of kids have gone
missing during school hours, over the course of years. As a personal
favor to Lara, the Hunter goes undercover as a teenager, in search of
the demon hiding among the teens.</p>
<p>Like the frog demons from summer camp, this particular demon is
extremely difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Hunter has been avoiding James, mostly because
he’s infatuated with her and she isn’t interested, but since Lara wants
her son to be safe, the Hunter shares his class schedule and he follows
her like an unwanted puppy.</p>
<p>At some point in this story, James will be badly injured and need a
transfusion. The only person available with a compatible blood type will
be the Hunter. Her half-demon blood will inadvertently activate dormant
fairy powers even his mother had no idea he had, on top of giving him
access to demon magic.</p>
<p>The time frame for this one will be about thirteen years after <a
href="#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>.</p>
<p>It’s just possible this one will become a full-blown novel of its
own, since I fully intend to spin off a series about James. The series
is likely to be titled <em>Demon Blood</em>.</p>
<h3 id="she-hunts-strangers">She Hunts Strangers</h3>
<p>This short story will be set after the events of <a
href="#smart-bomb">Smart Bomb</a>. It will take place during the same
time frame as <a
href="../wizards-scion/forgotten-legends.html">Forgotten Legends</a>.
She may or may not have the robot from that book as her partner in this
story, depending on the result of their conflict.</p>
<p>The Hunter notices the disappearance of children from the streets of
Neo York City and begins an independent investigation, despite
constantly running-afoul of local police, who are following much the
same leads.</p>
<p>Unlike the police, however, she suspects something supernatural is
happening and she’s not wrong, though it isn’t the demons she suspected.
She soon uncovers the existence of the Strangers, a type of creature
born from the beliefs of children, because small children don’t really
believe a human would ever kidnap someone and a Stranger is born from
their childish beliefs that is must be a monster.</p>
<p>She begins a crusade to end the Stranger threat by violence, because
she’s always considered it her highest duty to protect innocent children
and she’s joined by a pair of police detective that realize they’re
totally out of their depth.</p>
<p>Will they end the Strangers, or will the child-eating monsters slip
though their fingers?</p>
