1972, she senses the return of her demonic arch-nemesis, Vogerath, to
the world. Following his magic like a bloodhound, she finds herself
inexplicably drawn to Vietnam, a war zone.</p>
<p>With a pressing need to kill Vogerath, who claims to be the serpent
from the Garden of Eden, the half-demon Hunter is joined by her
detective partner, Clayton Simmons, and a powerful witch, Verda
Bagley.</p>
<p>It was meant to be a simple search and destroy mission, but nothing
in the jungles of Vietnam is ever simple and their plans go off the
rails the moment the Hunter sets foot on the ground. She’s overcome by
the magic of the jungle, which causes her to forget her humanity and
transform into a great, black cat with blue eyes!</p>
<p>Her team are forced to subdue her, to bring her back to her senses,
but the consequences of her instinct-driven actions leave them troubled,
because she killed a demon disguised as an American soldier and his best
friend wants revenge! As this fresh, unwanted conflict comes to a close,
the Hunter’s hands are reluctantly stained with human blood.</p>
<p>Vogerath’s jungle hideout is surrounded by soldiers and the raid
begins, but the Hunter’s plan continues to go wrong. After a unit of
tanks is overrun, the US military throws everything they’ve got at the
demons, inadvertently playing into Vogerath’s hands! The demon grows
stronger with each attack and awaits the power of a nuclear strike,
planning to use it to open a portal to Hell, so endless legions of
demons can march forth to conquer the Earth!</p>
Will the Hunter and her friends stop Vogerath in time or will the world
be conquered by demons? Buy this book today and find out!

horrifying of challenges: teenagers. This novella is also available

teens, was the last place the Hunter wanted to go, but she’d made a vow
to protect humanity from demons, no matter where they appeared and in
1986, her team of demon-slaying experts is called on to investigate.
However, to make things even worse, the Hunter’s team leader sends her
into the camp as an undercover operative, under the guise of a regular
teen, despite the fact that the half-demon girl being old enough to be
the grandmother of the kids at camp.</p>
<p>She’s soon caught up in the daily minutiae of camp, learning a few
new things along the way, while followed around like a puppy by a new
“friend”, a motor-mouthed girl that never shuts up. On the very first
day, she also acquires a trio of teenage foes in the form of some
valley-girl sisters from Los Angeles, who take every opportunity to
insult and plays pranks on her.</p>
<p>However, despite the innocent look of the place, danger lurks around
every corner, because the owner of the camp, Miss Macie Weber, is an
untrained witch, whose unknowing, haywire magic threatens to kill
everyone by summoning powerful and vengeful nature spirits, on top of
the demons already lurking among the humans at camp!</p>
Will the Hunter find and slay the the demons or will the nature spirits
take offense at her mere presence, because she’s had the Jungle Spirit
stuck inside her head since 1972?
