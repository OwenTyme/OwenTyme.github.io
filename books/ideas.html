<h1 id="ideas">Ideas</h1>
<p>This page is a sort of catch-all bin of ideas for novels I may write
in the future.</p>
<h2 id="demon-blood">Demon Blood</h2>
<p>This would be a spin-off of <a href="ashen-blades/index.html">Ashen
Blades</a> centered around the life of James Simmons. He’s a fairy, like
his mother, Lara, but he appears totally normal until probably the age
of fifteen or sixteen, at which point he’s badly injured and needs an
emergency transfusion.</p>
<p>The only person available at the time with a compatible blood type is
the Hunter/Artemis Watson, a half-demon. She donates her blood and it
activates all of the young man’s dormant powers.</p>
<p>He also turns out to be rather good at demon extermination, able to
force demons to transform, with a touch. He uses this power to forcibly
turn demons into weapons, which he uses to kill others. Best of all: his
power fully drains his weapons of all magic, permanently killing
them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he becomes a half-demon, and the demons now seek to
use him in their plots to conquer the world, very similar to
Artemis.</p>
<h2 id="second-star-working-title">Second Star (Working Title)</h2>
<p>Second star is a re-telling of Peter Pan from the perspective of
Captain Hook, with Peter cast as the villain. The setting would be based
on a twisting of many fairy tales and I’m planning to go for a gritty,
realistic feeling to the story, despite the fact it will be satire. I
may go with a Noir-style of writing, with guns and tech from the 1940’s,
though there will certainly also be magic and magical creatures.</p>
<p>Hook would be a police captain with a personal grudge against Pan,
who’s the king-pin of the local drug trade, which is based on Pixie
Dust, a hallucinogen literally produced by shaking enslaved pixies.</p>
<p>True to the original story, Pan cut Hook’s hand off and fed it to an
alligator. That led to Hook being re-assigned from narcotics to vice for
a time, which will lead to Pan nicknaming him “Captain Hooker”, just to
tick him off.</p>
<p>The novel will begin with Tinkerbell turning herself in to the
police, but she refuses to tell her story to anyone other than Hook.
That gets Hook back on the case and he sees things through from there.
Tink and Pan used to be equal partners, but when Tink grew a conscience
and wanted to stop selling drugs to kids, Pan imprisoned her, then
captured more pixies, to force them to produce more Pixie Dust.</p>
<p>I have lots of ideas for incorporating elements of the original
story, as well as many other fairy tales.</p>
<p>For example, Neverland is Pan’s nightclub, a speakeasy that the cops
can’t find, because only fairies and those high on Pixie Dust can see
the way. The directions “second star to the right and straight on till
morning” confuse them, because Second Star and Morning are street names,
but they’re parallel to each other and never cross. Only in the fairy
realm do they actually share an intersection and that’s where Neverland
is. Neverland got it’s name through Pan saying, “The cops won’t never
find this land!”</p>
<p>I plan to include Pinocchio as one of Pan’s street-level pushers.
Hook uses him as a reliable source of information, because every time
the puppet lies, his nose grows. Unfortunately, Hook doesn’t know that
Pan uses the puppet to feed Hook false information.</p>
<p>Pixie Dust has a powerful side-effect on children, slowing or even
stopping the aging process. Pan, for example, is hundreds of years old,
yet he’s never fully grown out of childish habits.</p>
<p>Pan’s gang, the Lost Boys, are nearly as old as Pan. Every one of
them is a nasty piece of work, fully of the cynicism of the streets, yet
childish as can be. Those that appear to be teens, like Pan, are the
most dangerous. They’re intellectually adults, but emotionally volatile
and prone to murderous behavior. Those that appear younger are less
trouble, but due to the way they haven’t mentally developed, they’re
effectively slaves to the older members of the gang and don’t even know
it.</p>
<p>The Lost Boys are constantly looking for new recruits and they easily
find them when children disagree with their parents, usually over petty
matters, like bedtime.</p>
<p>However, they’re just as likely to sell them drugs, instead.</p>
<p>The climax of the novel will involve Pan blowing a handful of Pixie
Dust in Hook’s face, while growling, “Could you just lighten up, for
once?”</p>
<p>At that point, Hook will wander the streets, high as a kite, but
he’ll finally see how the streets bend and cross, at least in his mind.
Before he begins to come down, he gathers men from the station, in full
tactical gear, and leads them in a raid on Neverland, leading to a grand
melee with the Lost Boys, while Hook confronts Pan.</p>
<h2 id="thorn-of-the-rose-working-title">Thorn of the Rose (Working
Title)</h2>
<p>Sandra Blake loses her parents to an unexpected attack by a
mysterious assassin. Her mother’s final words, “Don’t let it end like
this” have a chilling effect on her life and Sandra transforms herself,
both body and soul, becoming an incredibly skilled and dangerous
woman.</p>
<p>After years of intense training, she enters the seedy underworld of
modern society, exchanging stolen jewels for information on the man that
killed her parents.</p>
<p>Her uncle, Daniel Malachi, seeks to bring her in from the field, to
make her part of the Imperial Intelligence Core, which her oversees.</p>
<p>Naturally, they come into conflict, but Sandra goes through Malachi’s
men like a lawn mower cuts grass. Nonetheless, when her uncle speaks to
her, her resolve weakens and she agrees to work for him as a spy.</p>
<p>Will Sandra stay on task and do as she’s told, or will she go
off-book to find the man she wants to punish?</p>
<p>This would be a rewrite of a novel I started in college (20 years
ago), which I lacked the skill to finish at the time.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite qualities of Sandra were the contradiction
between how much pain she feels and how capable she is, as well as her
tendency to defeat high tech security gadgets with simple kitchen
utensils. Add her total lack of understanding of computer software (she
had a rudimentary understanding of networking cables, however, in the
sense of knowing what they were and how to cut them) and she was quite
fun to write.</p>
<p>This more modern variation would take place in the Northwestern
Empire, likely during the time skip at the end of <a
href="wizards-scion/the-inverted-glass.html">The Inverted Glass</a>.
Daniel Malachi was originally seen in <a
href="sky-children/sky-children.html">Sky Children</a> and also appeared
in <a href="wizards-scion/the-third-wish.html">The Third Wish</a>, after
which he became the new spy master for the Empress of the Northwestern
Empire.</p>
<p>While Malachi is a wizard, he doesn’t flaunt that ability and not
even Sandra will know, at least until she needs to.</p>
<p>The original version of the novel opened with Sandra pretending to be
a student at a clandestine school for spies on the first day of class,
while their teacher was absent. This turned out to be ploy to avoid
teaching, a task she never wanted, but since she’s pregnant, she’s been
removed from active duty and relegated to teaching.</p>
<p>She teaches the Unconventional Tactics class, mostly by telling them
her life story, which serves as an excellent example of doing everything
the wrong way, while getting excellent results.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how much of the old novel will be used, but there’s
plenty to build on and the experience of writing Sandra has had a lot of
influence over the writer I’ve become.</p>
<h2 id="the-renegade-god">The Renegade God</h2>
<p>In a humorous setting in which gods gain power through human belief,
one particular goddess has a tendency to step on the toes of other gods,
by gaining aspects that are uncomfortably close to their areas of
influence, ultimately usurping them, by stealing their worshipers.</p>
<p>For this, she’s cursed by the other gods, yet she isn’t dissuaded,
continually visiting the mortal realm to spreads new religions based on
her. She usually reaches by falling from the sky, because shes initially
pushed off the cloud that serves as the home of the gods, but over time,
she will choose to dive off.</p>
<p>Every time she lands, she leaves a crater and loses her memories, not
realizing she’s a god. She usually also loses her divine regalia along
the way, including a pair of ruby high heels that bear a measure of her
power. It normally takes her years to recover her memories, long after
she’s spread a new religion.</p>
<p>She eventually finds her pet goose, which goes out looking for her
whenever she leaves the abode of the gods, and rides it home. Every
visit home leads to a new trial for her crimes against the other gods,
for which she’s cast down again, starting the process anew.</p>
<p>This is likely to read like a series of intertwined tales, but it
won’t be a collection of short stories, because the narrative will be
tighter than that.</p>
<p>By the end of the novel, the renegade will become the chief of the
gods, simply because she has more worshipers than any other.</p>
<p>I’ll play up the renegade’s curse for comedic effect and treat her
relationship with the other gods as another source of comedy.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-left-to-chance">Nothing Left to Chance</h2>
<p>Death is a job passed from one mortal to another over the centuries,
a job with a great many perks, including immortality, but the catch is a
doozy: death is always scrambling collect to dark souls that need to be
controlled. Worse, if Death fails and the dark souls are left unchecked,
the world will come to an end.</p>
<p>Each Death begins normal enough, then comes to an end the usual way,
but a long-standing bargain between humanity and the grim reaper entails
an ancient ritual challenge: if a mortal can beat Death in any game,
they gain immortality. The trouble is, Death can’t be beat, unless Death
chooses to lose.</p>
<p>This has happened before and will inevitably happen again, because
mortals were never meant to live forever, and sooner or later, the
Reaper always tires of Reaping. It may take ten-thousand years or just
ten, but all good things must come to an end.</p>
<p>The downside is that this usually involves all of the collected dark
souls being released, which forces the new guy to pick up the slack,
lest the world end.</p>
<p>Dragons, monsters, creatures of legend, even dark and forgotten gods
with an ax to grind – they all have to be captured and contained.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the previous Reaper always sticks around for a while,
usually in the form of a talking skull, because someone has to teach the
new guy.</p>
<p>Each book in this series would bear only a tenuous connection to the
rest and each volume in it can stand alone, with no need to write them
in any particular order. Each would focus on a particular Reaper, though
it’s possible I may find I like any given character and give them an
extra volume or two.</p>
<p>The common elements of the series from Reaper to Reaper will consist
of each facing terrible calamities in order to save the world, requiring
some choice of vessel to contain the dark souls, which determines the
powers they manifest. However, all Reapers share the power to manipulate
and travel through time, which is essential for them to ferry the souls
of the living to the afterlife.</p>
<p>In addition, they also have to choose something or someone to serve
as their immortal companion. This is traditionally a horse, but there
are a great many options available, including motorcycles, cars, other
people, etc.</p>
<h3 id="chance-on-a-gamble">Chance on a Gamble</h3>
<p>A young man that lives by gambling dies in a motorcycle accident and
meets Death, who offers him a rare chance at immortality, through a game
of poker.</p>
<p>He wins and becomes Death, while Death crumbles to just a powerless
skull, which had been serving as the containment vessel.</p>
<p>After several women reject the opportunity, the young man chooses his
motorcycle as his companion, which becomes imbued with life, then
chooses to use his deck of cards and his dice to contain the souls. The
powers he gains are extremely strong, but subject to random chance and
tend to burn out after a while.</p>
<p>To challenge myself, I’ll come up with random effects to attach to
the cards of a deck or the roll of the dice, then I’ll randomly choose
as required to determine which power he gets at any given time. During
the climax, he’ll finally find a way to stack the deck ahead of time,
rather than shuffling.</p>
<p>The more souls he gathers, the less time it will take for individual
cards to recharge after use.</p>
<h3 id="gunslingers-chance">Gunslinger’s Chance</h3>
<p>The Reaper of the Old West era began as an outlaw gunfighter, who
challenged death to a fast-draw contest of the sort favored in
Westerns.</p>
<p>Death loses on purpose and the outlaw finally finds out about the
fine print of the arrangement, forced to defend a world he hates,
because the alternative is worse.</p>
<p>The outlaw chooses his horse as his companion and his pistol as the
vessel. Each soul he captures will give him a unique power his bullets
can manifest, based on the defeated monster.</p>
<h3 id="chance-for-a-soldier">Chance for a Soldier</h3>
<p>A soldier that died on the battlefield during World War II defeats
Death in a bare knuckle bar fight.</p>
<p>The soldier chooses his best friend as a companion and their fists
serve to contain the souls. Each soul they collect will give them
greater durability and physical strength, eventually becoming like
super-heroes.</p>
<p>Together, they fight both dark souls and Nazis, but as they begin to
sway the outcome of the war, Reapers from other eras appear, to stop
them, lest they destroy the foundations of reality, by altering what was
meant to be.</p>
<p>The Reapers brawl like no battle that came before and whole cities
are decimated by the fighting.</p>
<h3 id="shinigami-of-chance">Shinigami of Chance</h3>
<p>At one point, the reaper was a Japanese samurai, who used his sword
as the the vessel and his armor as his companion. His armor became
imbued with life and the samurai came to think of it as being possessed
by a helpful, yet very clever fox yokai.</p>
<p>This one chose to think of himself as a shinigami, rather than a
Reaper.</p>
<h3 id="a-chance-insight">A Chance Insight</h3>
<p>The Reaper of this novel is a con artist that makes her living as a
fake psychic or medium.</p>
<p>She chooses her crystal ball as both the containment vessel and her
companion. She gains the rather unreliable power to gaze into the
future, while her crystal ball starts talking and can shape shift at her
command. She often uses it in the form of blunt instruments (like a
mace), since it’s made of extremely durable and heavy quartz.</p>
<h3 id="a-magical-chance">A Magical Chance</h3>
<p>The Reaper from the 1960’s is the lovely assistant of a magician and
also his wife.</p>
<p>She chooses her husband as her companion and makes magic itself the
containment vessel, transforming it into more than a mere slight-of-hand
trick.</p>
<h3 id="the-last-chance">The Last Chance</h3>
<p>The previous Reaper chooses poorly and gives his power to a man that
wishes to watch the world crumble, after losing his wife.</p>
<p>The Earth comes closer than ever to destruction as dark and evil
energy fills the world, fracturing both time and space, bringing Reapers
from the past into the present, each of them fighting to hold off the
catastrophe, despite the fact they lack the power, since they’re only
echoes of what was.</p>
<p>The new Reaper falls for one of the female Reapers of the past and
she convinces him to care, through small acts of romance. He chooses her
as his companion and together, they fight to end the catastrophe, but
the world may be too far-gone to save.</p>
<p>In a strange twist, the Reaper chooses his bond with his new wife as
his containment vessel and the attraction between them manifests as a
force that may be just enough to seal the cracks in space/time, or
possibly not…</p>
<p>This volume would likely be the last, a chance to bring the other
main characters together for one big adventure, while elements of the
real world, the future and even alternate histories mingle together.</p>
