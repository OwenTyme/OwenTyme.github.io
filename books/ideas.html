<p>This page is a sort of catch-all bin of ideas for novels I may write
in the future.</p>
<h2 id="bloody-innocent-heroes-working-title">Bloody Innocent Heroes
(Working Title)</h2>
<p>I haven’t selected a proper title for this series yet, but <em>The
Four Corners</em> refers to questing all over the world to collect
artifacts. Alternatively, <em>Innocent Blooded</em> or <em>Bloody
Innocent Heroes</em> do also sound suitable. I currently favor that last
option.</p>
<p>Some mysterious and secretive individual brings a group of
adventurers together.</p>
<p>Two of them will be condemned prisoners that have been put in cages
beside one of the main trade routes of the kingdom. Both were caught
red-handed, so to speak, completely covered in the blood of victims they
murdered, though they have no idea why they did it. Each of them
remembers doing the deed, but can’t remember what motivated them.</p>
<p>One will be a priest that should have lost his powers as a result of
his actions, but he hasn’t and he doesn’t know why. He turned himself in
and confessed to his crime. During his trial, he was accused of secretly
working with a death god as an explanation of the fact he retained his
powers, but that isn’t true.</p>
<p>The other is a dwarf warrior/smith, who bludgeoned someone to death
with his smithing hammer, a fact that deeply disturbs him, not only due
to the death, but also from disrespect of his favored tool. He’s
convinced that someone mind-controlled him and he insisted on this story
throughout the trial.</p>
<p>The third member of the party is man that used to be a human thief,
who crossed a wizard and got permanently transformed into a dog, though
he retains his memories, for now. This dog finds the first two in their
cages and takes pity on them, stealing food for them. Unfortunately, he
can’t read or write, putting a real damper on communication.</p>
<p>The priest is bothered by the theft, but accepts the food, because he
will otherwise die. The dog doesn’t like the dwarf, however, because
they initially eye them with great hunger and says, “There’s good eatin’
on a dog, even a scrawny mutt like that.” The priest shares the food
with the dwarf.</p>
<p>The fourth member of the party is an impressionable teenage witch,
who finds them in their cages and sets them free, but she claims she’s
working on behalf of someone else.</p>
<p>In her case, she assaulted someone with a club, but she doesn’t know
why. She’s perplexed by the fact she didn’t know her victim and wasn’t
using magic to attack them. The watch caught her in the act and she was
sold as a slave to pay her debt to society. Her new owner is allowing
her to work off her debt by performing tasks for him, including freeing
the others.</p>
<p>The main characters are mostly grateful for what their benefactor is
doing for them, with the exception of the dog, who’s deeply suspicious,
but can’t express himself properly.</p>
<p>They’re taken by the witch to a secret, mountain fortress, which once
belonged to some bandits.</p>
<p>Only the witch ever speaks with their employer and she passes along
word of what he wants done. Their employer insists that he believes
they’re all innocent and claims he has other agents investigating their
cases, to find evidence to clear their names.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he’ll provide them with food, shelter and even some
spending money, if they’ll search some ancient ruins for a series of
magic artifacts he’s collecting.</p>
<p>The real truth is that the three humanoids are patsies and their
employer is a ghost. He possessed each of them, in turn, taking over
just long enough to get them in serious trouble, while simultaneously
eliminating two of his previous agents and sending a warning message to
a third.</p>
<p>He has no intention of helping his new agents out of the predicaments
he’s put them in.</p>
<p>The artifacts are part of an ancient magical device that can
supposedly grant a ghost some rather serious power, which should be
enough to keep him solid all the time, on top of making him
nigh-invulnerable.</p>
<p>The witch is aware that he’s a ghost, but believes he’s hiding that
fact to avoid scaring the others.</p>
<p>This band of misfits will collect the pieces of the device and the
smith will reassemble it, with the help of the witch.</p>
<p>Just before the device is handed over, the dog will grab it and run
off. The ghost will lose his temper and say too much as he chases. The
others will be shocked by the revelation, ultimately siding with the
dog, leading to a knock-down, drag-out fight with their employer.</p>
<p>The device will be used to force the ghost to pass on to the
afterlife, which is the true purpose it was designed for, and their
first adventure will come to an end, but without clearing their
names.</p>
<p>This could easily become a series, with the characters doing various
jobs while they seek to clear their names and turn the dog back into a
human.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what universe this will be placed in, but <em>The Book
of Newts</em> and <em>Rumors of War/Null War</em> would both be
fitting.</p>
<p>If I choose <em>Rumors of War/Null War</em>, then the witch will be
the one with the dragon trapped inside her body. This is based on a
dragon demi-god trying to eat the entire world, to satiate his
hunger.</p>
<p>The mother of this witch faced the demi-god, alone, while her baby
daughter slowly died of something like a birth defect (she’s a chimera
of a witch and a null, a condition that’s supposed to be impossible to
survive).</p>
<p>Seeking to stop the dragon and give her daughter’s inevitable death
meaning, the mother uses her magic to seal the dragon inside her
daughter’s body, hoping the dragon will die with the infant.</p>
<p>The magic costs the mother her life and the dragon is sealed away,
effectively bonded to the girl’s life force. The mother dies thinking
the dragon is doomed, but the dragon manages to save the girl’s life, in
order to save his own.</p>
<p>The girl has both dragon and witch powers, making her basically
immortal, so long as the dragon remains trapped inside her.</p>
<p>If I go this route, then this series will serve as a prequel to
<em>Rumors of War</em>.</p>
<p>I think I’ll begin the opening scene something like this, focused on
the priest and the dwarf (their cages face different directions and
they’re effectively back to back):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Priest and Dwarf are in a pair of rusty, iron cages, beside a major
trade road. The cages dangle from an iron beam that’s mounted between a
pair of heavy, stone plinths, both of which are to one side of the
road.<br />
The two of them are back to back. Pries faces the road and Dwarf faces
the wilderness.</p>
<p>Priest: I think someone’s coming up the road!</p>
<p>Dwarf: Really?</p>
<p>Priest: It’s a little hard to tell, because my eyes aren’t in great
shape, but I see movement. I hope it’s someone coming to feed us!</p>
<p>Dwarf: Fat chance, ye cracked priest, because feeding us is against
the law. Ye and me are supposed to languish and die, on public display,
remember? The only thing anyone can give us is water, and that just
helps us linger a little longer, which is what makes it cruel and
unusual punishment.</p>
<p>Priest: I…I think it’s a woman carrying a sack of bread. That looks
so tasty!</p>
<p>Dwarf: Me hasn’t had bread in…in…</p>
<p>Priest: How long?</p>
<p>Dwarf (weeping without actual tears, because he’s dehydrated): Me
doesn’t remember, because me’s <em>so</em> hungry!</p>
<p>Dwarf tries to pick the lock on his cage with his bare fingers, yet
again. He finds no success, for a lack of lock picks, but it would do
him no good if he succeeded, because the cage was welded shut while he
was unconscious, a fact he hasn’t realized yet.</p>
<p>Priest: It’s <em>definitely</em> a woman with some bread.</p>
<p>Dwarf: Me’d like to see that, but me’s too weak to shift me legs.</p>
<p>Priest (hallucinating): Oh yeah! Really nice looking, too.
Well-proportioned. And the bread is also rather attractive: those big
and long loaves that crackle when you squeeze them. The good stuff!</p>
<p>Priest bites into an imaginary loaf of bread handed to him by the
imaginary woman.</p>
<p>Priest: Curse my eyes! I’m hallucinating again!</p>
<p>Dwarf: A real pity. What was it, for real?</p>
<p>Priest: Just a dirty old mutt that stopped to lick my face, which has
slightly quenched my thirst.</p>
<p>Dwarf twists and cranes his neck, to get a look.</p>
<p>Dwarf: There’s good eatin’ on a mutt like that. Break its neck and we
can feast!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="demon-blood">Demon Blood</h2>
<p>This would be a spin-off of <a href="ashen-blades/index.html">Ashen
Blades</a> centered around the life of James Simmons. He’s a fairy, like
his mother, Lara, but he appears totally normal until probably the age
of fifteen or sixteen, at which point he’s badly injured and needs an
emergency transfusion.</p>
<p>The only person available at the time with a compatible blood type is
the Hunter/Artemis Watson, a half-demon. She donates her blood and it
activates all of the young man’s dormant powers.</p>
<p>He also turns out to be rather good at demon extermination, able to
force demons to transform, with a touch. He uses this power to forcibly
turn demons into weapons, which he uses to kill others. Best of all: his
power eventually fully drains his weapons of all magic, permanently
killing them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he becomes a half-demon, and the demons now seek to
use him in their plots to conquer the world, very similar to
Artemis.</p>
<h2 id="fighter-for-hire-working-title">Fighter for Hire (Working
Title)</h2>
<p>In <em>Fighter for Hire</em>, a young and inexperienced fighter
answers an ad from an established group of adventurers seeking a
front-liner. He interviews for the position and is given a trial period
to prove himself in the field, while the group takes on a low priority
job, to try him out.</p>
<p>As they work, the fighter asks why they needed a fighter and the
others begin to tell the story of what happened to their old fighter,
each of them taking turns at telling the story. Each character
interrupts the narrative when they think the previous person is missing
or glossing over details, taking over the story.</p>
<p>Each chapter will be from the perspective of the current storyteller,
with short meta elements and arguments over details.</p>
<p>The overall tale will be about their last big job, which went wrong.
Each part of the story will illuminate a small point of how things went
wrong, contributing to the overall failure that lead to the death of
their missing friend.</p>
<p>The start of the climax will cover their fight with the big boss of
the dungeon/bandit leader/dragon/whatever it is they were working to
eliminate. It will end with the group losing their fighter and only
barely escaping with their lives.</p>
<p>The true climax will involve the group tackling the same job again,
with their new fighter. Armed with a more serious approach informed by
their past failures, they’ll win the day.</p>
<h2 id="second-star-working-title">Second Star (Working Title)</h2>
<p>Second star is a re-telling of Peter Pan from the perspective of
Captain Hook, with Peter cast as the villain. The setting would be based
on a twisting of many fairy tales and I’m planning to go for a gritty,
realistic feeling to the story, despite the fact it will be satire. I
may go with a Noir-style of writing, with guns and tech from the 1940’s,
though there will certainly also be magic and magical creatures.</p>
<p>Hook would be a police captain with a personal grudge against Pan,
who’s the king-pin of the local drug trade, which is based on Pixie
Dust, a hallucinogen literally produced by shaking enslaved pixies.</p>
<p>True to the original story, Pan cut Hook’s hand off and fed it to an
alligator. That led to Hook being re-assigned from narcotics to vice for
a time, which will lead to Pan nicknaming him “Captain Hooker”, just to
tick him off.</p>
<p>The novel will begin with Tinkerbell turning herself in to the
police, but she refuses to tell her story to anyone other than Hook.
That gets Hook back on the case and he sees things through from there.
Tink and Pan used to be equal partners, but when Tink grew a conscience
and wanted to stop selling drugs to kids, Pan imprisoned her, then
captured more pixies, to force them to produce more Pixie Dust.</p>
<p>I have lots of ideas for incorporating elements of the original
story, as well as many other fairy tales.</p>
<p>For example, Neverland is Pan’s nightclub, a speakeasy that the cops
can’t find, because only fairies and those high on Pixie Dust can see
the way. The directions “second star to the right and straight on till
morning” confuse them, because Second Star and Morning are street names,
but they’re parallel to each other and never cross. Only in the fairy
realm do they actually share an intersection and that’s where Neverland
is. Neverland got it’s name through Pan saying, “The cops won’t never
find this land!”</p>
<p>I plan to include Pinocchio as one of Pan’s street-level pushers.
Hook uses him as a reliable source of information, because every time
the puppet lies, his nose grows. Unfortunately, Hook doesn’t know that
Pan uses the puppet to feed Hook false information.</p>
<p>Pixie Dust has a powerful side-effect on children, slowing or even
stopping the aging process. Pan, for example, is hundreds of years old,
yet he’s never fully grown out of childish habits.</p>
<p>Pan’s gang, the Lost Boys, are nearly as old as Pan. Every one of
them is a nasty piece of work, full of the cynicism of the streets, yet
childish as can be. Those that appear to be teens, like Pan, are the
most dangerous. They’re intellectually adults, but emotionally volatile
and prone to murderous behavior. Those that appear younger are less
trouble, but due to the way they haven’t mentally developed, they’re
effectively slaves to the older members of the gang and don’t even know
it.</p>
<p>The Lost Boys are constantly looking for new recruits and they easily
find them when children disagree with their parents, usually over petty
matters, like bedtime.</p>
<p>However, they’re just as likely to sell them drugs, instead.</p>
<p>The climax of the novel will involve Pan blowing a handful of Pixie
Dust in Hook’s face, while growling, “Could you just lighten up, for
once?”</p>
<p>At that point, Hook will wander the streets, high as a kite, but
he’ll finally see how the streets bend and cross, at least in his mind.
Before he begins to come down, he gathers men from the station, in full
tactical gear, then leads them in a raid on Neverland, concluding the
novel as a grand melee with the Lost Boys, while Hook confronts Pan.</p>
<h2 id="thorn-of-the-rose-working-title">Thorn of the Rose (Working
Title)</h2>
<p>Sandra Blake loses her parents to an unexpected attack by a
mysterious assassin. Her mother’s final words, “Don’t let it end like
this” have a chilling effect on her life and Sandra transforms herself,
both body and soul, becoming an incredibly skilled and dangerous
woman.</p>
<p>After years of intense training, she enters the seedy underworld of
modern society, exchanging stolen jewels for information on the man that
killed her parents.</p>
<p>Her uncle, Daniel Malachi, seeks to bring her in from the field, to
make her part of the Imperial Intelligence Core, which her oversees.</p>
<p>Naturally, they come into conflict, but Sandra goes through Malachi’s
men like a lawn mower cuts grass. Nonetheless, when her uncle speaks to
her, her resolve weakens and she agrees to work for him as a spy.</p>
<p>Will Sandra stay on task and do as she’s told, or will she go
off-book to find the man she wants to punish?</p>
<p>This would be a rewrite of a novel I started in college (20 years
ago), which I lacked the skill to finish at the time.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite qualities of Sandra were the contradiction
between how much pain she feels and how capable she is, as well as her
tendency to defeat high tech security gadgets with simple kitchen
utensils. Add her total lack of understanding of computer software (she
had a rudimentary understanding of networking cables, however, in the
sense of knowing what they were and how to cut them) and she was quite
fun to write.</p>
<p>This more modern variation would take place in the Northwestern
Empire, likely during the time skip at the end of <a
href="wizards-scion/the-inverted-glass.html">The Inverted Glass</a>.
Daniel Malachi was originally seen in <a
href="sky-children/sky-children.html">Sky Children</a> and also appeared
in <a href="wizards-scion/the-third-wish.html">The Third Wish</a>, after
which he became the new spy master for the Empress of the Northwestern
Empire.</p>
<p>While Malachi is a wizard, he doesn’t flaunt that ability and not
even Sandra will know, at least until she needs to.</p>
<p>The original version of the novel opened with Sandra pretending to be
a student at a clandestine school for spies on the first day of class,
while their teacher was absent. This turned out to be ploy to avoid
teaching, a task she never wanted, but since she’s pregnant, she’s been
removed from active duty and relegated to teaching.</p>
<p>She teaches the Unconventional Tactics class, mostly by telling them
her life story, which serves as an excellent example of doing everything
the wrong way, while getting excellent results.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how much of the old novel will be used, but there’s
plenty to build on and the experience of writing Sandra has had a lot of
influence over the writer I’ve become.</p>
<h2 id="the-renegade-god">The Renegade God</h2>
<p>In a humorous setting in which gods gain power through human belief,
one particular goddess has a tendency to step on the toes of other gods,
by gaining aspects that are uncomfortably close to their areas of
influence, ultimately usurping them, by stealing their worshipers.</p>
<p>For this, she’s cursed by the other gods, yet she isn’t dissuaded,
continually visiting the mortal realm to spread new religions based on
her. She usually reaches the mortal realm by falling from the sky,
because shes initially pushed off the cloud that serves as the home of
the gods, but over time, she will choose to dive off.</p>
<p>Every time she lands, she leaves a crater and loses her memories, not
realizing she’s a god. She usually also loses her divine regalia along
the way, including a pair of ruby high heels that bear a measure of her
power. It normally takes her years to recover her memories, long after
she’s spread a new religion.</p>
<p>She eventually finds her pet goose, which goes out looking for her
whenever she leaves the abode of the gods, and rides it home. Every
visit home leads to a new trial for her crimes against the other gods,
for which she’s cast down again, starting the process anew.</p>
<p>This is likely to read like a series of intertwined tales, but it
won’t be a collection of short stories, because the narrative will be
tighter than that.</p>
<p>By the end of the novel, the renegade will become the chief of the
gods, simply because she has more worshipers than any other.</p>
<p>I’ll play up the renegade’s curse for comedic effect and treat her
relationship with the other gods as another source of comedy.</p>
<h2 id="marie-antionette"><sup>Marie</sup>/<sub>Antoinette</sub></h2>
<p>This piece will be strictly a sci-fi novel and will also stand alone.
It’s possible I could turn it into a series, but I currently have no
plans for that.</p>
<p>Marie is an undercover cop with multiple personalities. The two
personalities are Marie and <em>The Other Girl</em>, an old name Marie
chose for her second personality as a child. She has a talent for
computers and even a little knowledge of hacking, a skill she
occasionally uses on the job.</p>
<p>She’s part of an operation investigating the owner of a
biotech/cybernetics company, because he’s rumored to be a mobster.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Marie is discovered and the mobster uses her for an
awful experiment. As it turns out, he’s been experimenting with
technology to wipe a person’s mind, followed by rewriting their brain
with a new personality.</p>
<p>The villain didn’t count on Marie having two personalities, however,
and the technology doesn’t quite work. <em>The Other Girl</em> rises to
the surface, because her purpose is to protect Marie. <em>The Other
Girl</em> is erased and replaced with a new personality named
Antoinette, a little joke from the villain.</p>
<p>Antoinette becomes the villain’s personal assassin, who puts a lot of
cybernetic hardware in Marie’s body.</p>
<p>Marie eventually comes to the surface again, but finds herself
overwhelmed with pain she can’t handle, subsiding again. This is because
the villain took no care for her comfort when he installed the
cybernetics, leaving her pain center constantly stimulated.</p>
<p>As an artificial personality that has more in common with a computer
program, Antoinette doesn’t have an emotional reaction to pain. She does
register new pain as the means to track injury, but she disregards
existing pain.</p>
<p>Marie eventually regains consciousness again, but takes a more
hands-off approach, observing from her own subconscious, while
Antoinette kills for the villain.</p>
<p>Eventually, the facility that radios her with new instructions is
assaulted by the military, led by Marie’s boyfriend. He’s a special ops
soldier and quite eager to find Marie, even though the police department
has marked her down as missing, presumed dead (the villain may have
altered a corpse to look like her, or may have cloned her, just to throw
the police off).</p>
<p>Everyone responsible for giving Antoinette orders is killed or
captured and their equipment is destroyed, something that Antoinette
becomes aware of, due to the network connection going down. She has some
understanding of what happened, but has no orders regarding loss of
contact and doesn’t know what to do.</p>
<p>Antoinette is left with very simple orders: “Stay out of sight and
kill any witnesses until further notice.”</p>
<p>She hides in a slum for a prolonged period of time, until a boy spots
her and approaches. She’s about to kill him, but receives new orders,
despite the fact she knows the transmitter at the other end has shut
down. She’s ordered to never kill children.</p>
<p>Marie is the source of all further orders and she’s managed to hack
the computer hardware connected to her brain, using it to give
Antoinette some new orders, though she can’t yet countermand existing
orders. She can only add fresh orders.</p>
<p>The second order Marie gives causes Antoinette to completely shut
down her radio transceiver.</p>
<p>From that point on, Marie will use Antoinette as a tool to achieve
her own goals. She’ll initially try to contact her friends over the
phone, but can’t get Antoinette to speak, due to prior direct orders
from the villain. Instead, she quietly looks for proof she can deliver
to the police, without being seen, acting in a manner similar to a
vigilante. She delivers trussed-up mobsters to the police station, along
with evidence to ensure a conviction, while she seeks dirt on the man at
the top.</p>
<p>The novel will have a dual plot structure, but both threads will
follow the main character. Marie will be the subject of one thread,
starting with the childhood trauma that gave her a second personality,
while the other will follow Antoinette, starting with her first field
test. I won’t make it clear that they’re the same person until about
halfway through the book.</p>
<h2 id="p.r.o.t.e.g.e.">P.R.O.T.E.G.E.</h2>
<p>The Protective Recon Operations Taskforce for Extraterrestrial
Gathering and Elimination is a multinational organization setup to
protect the human race from aliens, though they’ll deal with most
anything that’s a threat to humanity, including supernatural threats.
They’re a black-budget, paramilitary organization that doesn’t
officially exist.</p>
<p>PROTEGE keeps everything a secret and keeps humanity in the dark
regarding aliens, supposedly for their own good. However, they have a
rather bad reputation for being overly anti-alien, to the point of
needless hatred, but that may or may not be true.</p>
<p>The story will follow a new recruit, a shape-shifting alien in
disguise. His job is to find the real truth behind the disappearance of
a peaceful group sent to study humans. If PROTEGE is responsible, then
it may lead to war. If the alien infiltrator discovers the fact PROTEGE
has multinational support, then the aliens may declare war on all of
humanity.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he’s constantly distracted from his primary mission by
PROTEGE-assigned missions, which keep him in the field, rather than at
home base. Over time, he emotionally bonds with the human members of his
team and begins to lose himself in the role.</p>
<p>I haven’t yet decided on an outcome for the story, but in my mind,
PROTEGE has always been evil, run by humans that hate and victimize
aliens, yet their field operatives are not quite so evil, which may be
what makes it so hard to find the truth.</p>
<p>Perhaps the alien’s goal will transition to replacing the current
leaders of the organization, rather than starting a war, which could
lead to a long struggle over the course of a series. I could easily see
the climax as a confrontation between the alien and the people at the
top. If he wins, then he’ll replace them and subtly change the
organization’s mission. However, since that was basically what happened
in the <em>Supergirl</em> TV show, I think I’ll take a different
approach.</p>
<p>More likely, I would seek a middle-ground path, in which he confronts
them honestly and tells them of the threat they’ve become to themselves.
That will lead to a fight between those that see things his way and the
rest, who refuse to change.</p>
<p>In North America, PROTEGE operates out of an underground bunker
hidden beneath a kitty litter factory, which serves as a cover story.
Officially, the operatives that work out of the base are employed by the
factory.</p>
<p>Naturally, this novel/series would use a lot of conspiracy theory
stuff, most of which would be played up for comedic effect.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-left-to-chance">Nothing Left to Chance</h2>
<p>Death is a job passed from one mortal to another over the centuries,
a job with a great many perks, including immortality, but the catch is a
doozy: death is always scrambling collect to dark souls that need to be
controlled. Worse, if Death fails and the dark souls are left unchecked,
the world will come to an end.</p>
<p>Each Death begins normal enough, then comes to an end the usual way,
but a long-standing bargain between humanity and the grim reaper entails
an ancient ritual challenge: if a mortal can beat Death in any game,
they gain immortality. The trouble is, Death can’t be beat, unless Death
chooses to lose.</p>
<p>This has happened before and will inevitably happen again, because
mortals were never meant to live forever, and sooner or later, the
Reaper always tires of Reaping. It may take ten-thousand years or just
ten, but all good things must come to an end.</p>
<p>The downside is that this usually involves all of the collected dark
souls being released, which forces the new guy to pick up the slack,
lest the world end.</p>
<p>Dragons, monsters, creatures of legend, even dark and forgotten gods
with an ax to grind – they all have to be captured and contained.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the previous Reaper always sticks around for a while,
usually in the form of a talking skull, because someone has to teach the
new guy.</p>
<p>Each book in this series would bear only a tenuous connection to the
rest and each volume in it can stand alone, with no need to write them
in any particular order. Each would focus on a particular Reaper, though
it’s possible I may find I like any given character and give them an
extra volume or two.</p>
<p>The common elements of the series from Reaper to Reaper will consist
of each facing terrible calamities in order to save the world, requiring
some choice of vessel to contain the dark souls, which determines the
powers they manifest. However, all Reapers share the power to manipulate
and travel through time, which is essential for them to ferry the souls
of the living to the afterlife.</p>
<p>In addition, they also have to choose something or someone to serve
as their immortal companion. This is traditionally a horse, but there
are a great many options available, including motorcycles, cars, other
people, etc.</p>
<h3 id="chance-on-a-gamble">Chance on a Gamble</h3>
<p>A young man that lives by gambling dies in a motorcycle accident and
meets Death, who offers him a rare chance at immortality, through a game
of poker.</p>
<p>He wins and becomes Death, while Death crumbles to just a powerless
skull, which had been serving as the containment vessel.</p>
<p>After several women reject the opportunity, the young man chooses his
motorcycle as his companion, which becomes imbued with life, then
chooses to use his deck of cards and his dice to contain the souls. The
powers he gains are extremely strong, but subject to random chance and
tend to burn out after a while.</p>
<p>To challenge myself, I’ll come up with random effects to attach to
the cards of a deck or the roll of the dice, then I’ll randomly choose
as required to determine which power he gets at any given time. During
the climax, he’ll finally find a way to stack the deck ahead of time,
rather than shuffling.</p>
<p>The more souls he gathers, the less time it will take for individual
cards to recharge after use.</p>
<h3 id="gunslingers-chance">Gunslinger’s Chance</h3>
<p>The Reaper of the Old West era began as an outlaw gunfighter, who
challenged death to a fast-draw contest of the sort favored in
Westerns.</p>
<p>Death loses on purpose and the outlaw finally finds out about the
fine print of the arrangement, forced to defend a world he hates,
because the alternative is worse.</p>
<p>The outlaw chooses his horse as his companion and his pistol as the
vessel. Each soul he captures will give him a unique power his bullets
can manifest, based on the defeated monster.</p>
<h3 id="chance-for-a-soldier">Chance for a Soldier</h3>
<p>A soldier that died on the battlefield during World War II defeats
Death in a bare knuckle bar fight.</p>
<p>The soldier chooses his best friend as a companion and their fists
serve to contain the souls. Each soul they collect will give them
greater durability and physical strength, eventually becoming like
super-heroes.</p>
<p>Together, they fight both dark souls and Nazis, but as they begin to
sway the outcome of the war, Reapers from other eras appear, to stop
them, lest they destroy the foundations of reality, by altering what was
meant to be.</p>
<p>The Reapers brawl like no battle that came before and whole cities
are decimated by the fighting.</p>
<h3 id="shinigami-of-chance">Shinigami of Chance</h3>
<p>At one point, the reaper was a Japanese samurai, who used his sword
as the the vessel and his armor as his companion. His armor became
imbued with life and the samurai came to think of it as being possessed
by a helpful, yet very clever fox yokai.</p>
<p>This one chose to think of himself as a shinigami, rather than a
Reaper.</p>
<h3 id="a-chance-insight">A Chance Insight</h3>
<p>The Reaper of this novel is a con artist that makes her living as a
fake psychic or medium.</p>
<p>She chooses her crystal ball as both the containment vessel and her
companion. She gains the rather unreliable power to gaze into the
future, while her crystal ball starts talking and can shape shift at her
command. She often uses it in the form of blunt instruments (like a
mace), since it’s made of extremely durable and heavy quartz.</p>
<h3 id="a-magical-chance">A Magical Chance</h3>
<p>The Reaper from the 1960’s is the lovely assistant of a magician and
also his wife.</p>
<p>She chooses her husband as her companion and makes magic itself the
containment vessel, transforming it into more than a mere slight-of-hand
trick.</p>
<h3 id="the-last-chance">The Last Chance</h3>
<p>The previous Reaper chooses poorly and gives his power to a man that
wishes to watch the world crumble, after losing his wife.</p>
<p>The Earth comes closer than ever to destruction as dark and evil
energy fills the world, fracturing both time and space, bringing Reapers
from the past into the present, each of them fighting to hold off the
catastrophe, despite the fact they lack the power, since they’re only
echoes of what was.</p>
<p>The new Reaper falls for one of the female Reapers of the past and
she convinces him to care, through small acts of romance. He chooses her
as his companion and together, they fight to end the catastrophe, but
the world may be too far-gone to save.</p>
<p>In a strange twist, the Reaper chooses his bond with his new wife as
his containment vessel and the attraction between them manifests as a
force that may be just enough to seal the cracks in space/time, or
possibly not…</p>
<p>This volume would likely be the last, a chance to bring the other
main characters together for one big adventure, while elements of the
real world, the future and even alternate histories mingle together.</p>
