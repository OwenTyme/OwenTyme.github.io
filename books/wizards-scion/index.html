<h1 id="the-wizards-scion">The Wizard’s Scion</h1>
<p>This series follows the life of a great and powerful wizard’s son,
Levi Jacobs, as he grows from a teenage boy with almost no control over
his magic to a wizard of great power and reputation, that masters the
secrets of time travel.</p>
<p>The setting of this five volume series began as a relatively hard
science background, with only one big rubber science addition: some
faster than light technology that’s used for travel and communication.
Magic was largely unknown to everyone except the space pirate, until an
electrical engineer crash-landed on an “unexplored” planet that bore a
strange virus that gave him the powers of a wizard.</p>
<p>That electrical engineer who became a wizard was Levi’s father,
Zechariah. Zechariah is both directly and indirectly responsible for the
invention of many magi-tech devices, which mix magic and technology
together, using electricity to produce powerful spells beyond what any
wizard could do alone, leading to a setting in which wizards fly through
space in star ships that have the usual rubber science sci-fi bells and
whistles, including force fields and teleporters, as well as guns that
shoot magic spells.</p>
<h2 id="troll-song">Troll Song</h2>
<p><span class="book-cover"> <a href="troll-song.html"><img
src="../../images/Cover-TrollSong.jpeg" /></a> </span> The series starts
with <a href="troll-song.html">Troll Song</a>, which tells the tale of
an unusual young woman that catches his eye and who’s very important to
his story, named Lyra, who happens to be a troll.</p>
<p>She learns early on, by comparing her life to that of a dwarf, her
family are neither healthy nor particularly good and seeks to escape
them and <a href="troll-song.html">Troll Song</a> covers her journey to
freedom.</p>
<p><a href="troll-song.html">Troll Song</a> begins fully immersed in the
fantasy elements of the series and then begins introducing sci-fi
elements, after a large forward skip in time, because the main
characters got frozen in ice for two-thousand years.</p>
<p>That’s when Lyra meets Levi, who frees her from the ice and becomes
her first modern friend.</p>

volume, <a href="forgotten-legends.html">Forgotten Legends</a>, covers
the events of a war between humanity and the ancient, forgotten gods and
legendary creatures they once believed in, but have forgotten, due to
the rise of science.</p>
<p>Humanity inadvertently angers the legends by disturbing their last
refuge in reality and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse lead the
charge to strike back, with Levi and his family caught up in the
middle.</p>
<p>Unknown to Levi and his family, the fates have been manipulating
events to to bring about the death of his mother, Rachel, who has the
power to see the future and guide her own fate, which they see as an
affront.</p>
<p>Levi makes a new ally in this novel, in the form of the monster from
under his childhood bed, a creature of darkness named Inorath, which
used to give him nightmares and taunt him in the dark. They bond as
wizard and familiar, that they might work together to end the war.</p>

the Jacobs family come together to seek revenge, using a time machine,
with the intent to re-write history to suit themselves.</p>
<p>Worst of all, the time travelers bring Lyra’s evil sisters back to
life by cloning them, reigniting the conflict from <a
href="troll-song.html">Troll Song</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Levi deals with an angry, alien pirate, Captain Dandy, a
sentient dandelion with a sense of pride so strong that every tiny
slight becomes a mountain of offense. He’s angry over the way Levi’s
parents have treated him for two decades and seeks revenge by destroying
their world and their son.</p>
<p>As the conflict begins in earnest, Levi is shocked to meet his future
self, who gives him the chance to follow the time travelers into the

times.</p>

star ship and eventually tracks down the necromancer responsible for
their deaths and faces the witch in a magical duel.</p>
<p>He soon discovers the reasons for her actions aren’t cut and dried
evil and even admits he might have done the same thing.</p>
<p>As their duel comes to an end, the full moon rises and monsters fall
from it, splashing down in the ocean around them. They’re soon caught in

<p>In the depths of his deepest sorrow, he’s reminded he once saw
himself travel through time. He begins studying that most dangerous and
powerful of all magics, determined to regain everything he’s lost, but
when he does gain that power, he’s forced to confront the very fates
themselves, that he might gain permission to make the changes he
desires.</p>
<p>However, just getting an opportunity to speak with them is next to
impossible, because their cave is at the end of a perilous journey
through the Greek Underworld and the realm of Hades, who’s famed for his
dislike of living intruders.</p>
