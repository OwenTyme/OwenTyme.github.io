<p><em>The Inverted Glass</em> is the fifth and final volume of <a
href="index.html">The Wizard’s Scion</a>, which centers on the life of a

woken in the night by his pregnant wife, with happy news their child is
coming, but joy becomes tragedy as she dies in childbirth. Reeling from
this loss, he vows to raise their daughter to be a strong hero, just
like her mother, but even that fleeting comfort is stolen from the
bittersweet moment as the poor infant struggles to breathe and dies in
his arms!</p>
<p>Reeling at the loss, he staggers from one defeat to the next, slowly
losing everything else he cares about.</p>
<p>Finally, after a particularly traumatic defeat at the hands of a new
enemy, followed by a prolonged kidnapping involving the forced
administration of narcotics to make him compliant, he lies in the
infirmary of his ship, grief-stricken and struggling with addiction
withdrawal. Just when he’s at an all-time low, he’s offered a ray of
unusual hope, reminded that he once witnessed his future self travel
through time.</p>
<p>Armed with this memory, he focuses to unlock the secrets of temporal
magic, intent on undoing months of terrible events, only to find it’s
not so easy, because he has to fight to gain the approval of the Moirai,
better known as the Three Fates and speaking with them is no easy
task.</p>
Can Levi change history or will all that he loves remain forever lost in
the past?
