</div>
<p>I’m Owen Tyme, a self-published science fiction and fantasy author. I
live in Liberal, Kansas, in the United States. I was born in the
California Bay Area, where I lived in a town called Hayward. In between,
I spent quite a long time in Cedar City, Utah. I’m a member of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.</p>
<p>I really love to write action-filled science fantasy, as I prefer to
call it. I also write pure fantasy or science-fiction from time to time,
but I normally prefer to mix the two genres. Regardless of what I write,
however, I love science and I do my best to imagine how things work in a
scientific sense, even in the cases of dragons, wizards, witches and
elements not on the current periodic table, like mythril.</p>
<p>My favorite subjects are computer science, artificial intelligence,
biology, chemistry and electronics. I often surprise doctors by telling
them not to dumb things down for me, because I understand most of what
they say.</p>
<p>The current setting I’m writing in began with an electrical engineer
crash-landing on a planet with a special virus that gave him magic
powers, turning him into a wizard, though that novel has become a
prequel and hasn’t yet been re-released (it used to be up on Wattpad,
but I’ve since pulled all of my work from that site).</p>
<h2 id="favorite-authors">Favorite Authors</h2>
<p>Terry Pratchett is my favorite author and I still mourn his passing.
I just can’t bring myself to order and read his last Discworld book,
because if I do, then there won’t be another book in the series for me
to read for the first time. I think Pratchett is the reason I love to
ground even my fantasy works in science, because he always did that.</p>
<p>R.A. Salvatore is my second favorite and I love his books centered on
Drizzt Do’Urden. He’s probably the reason I love a good action scene and
prefer to write fast-paced material.</p>
<p>Douglas Adams makes me laugh out loud and I think he’s the reason my
writing often has wonderfully weird things woven into it, though I try
to avoid going to absurd extremes the way he did, unless writing
something comedic.</p>
<p>Isaac Asimov is another of my favorites, but I find my liking of his
work to be hit or miss. Sometimes I like his work and other times, I
just don’t. His science fiction usually works for me, though, especially
if it involves robots.</p>
<p>I also enjoy the writing of Mercedes Lackey, but sometimes find her
pacing suffers due to spending too much time describing things.</p>
<h2 id="my-publishing-mark">My Publishing Mark</h2>
<p><span class="book-cover"
style="border:0px;"><img src="images/logo.300x300.png" style="box-shadow:none;"></span>This
is my publishing mark, which goes on the spine of my books and I’d like
to take a moment to explain the hidden meaning.</p>
<p>Owen can easily be twisted into ‘owing’ and Tyme is obviously
pronounced the same as ‘time’.</p>
<p>Owen Tyme =&gt; Owing Time =&gt; Time Owed =&gt; Balance of Time.</p>
<p>The Yin-Yang represents balance and I’ve replaced the dots with
hourglasses to represent time.</p>
