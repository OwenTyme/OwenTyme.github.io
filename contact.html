<h1>Contacting Owen</h1>
<p>You can reach Owen Tyme via E-Mail at <a href="mailto:owentyme@owentyme.us" class="email">owentyme@owentyme.us</a>.</p>
<p>Owen welcomes contact with fans. He'll gladly answer questions about his novels or chat about the writing process. Please also feel free to <em>politely</em> report typos in his work.</p>
<p>Business inquiries may also be E-Mailed, but unless they're directly related to Owen's work as a writer, they will be deleted without response. For example, if you want to do a TV or movie adaptation of his work, feel free to reach out. On the other hand, if you're just trying to sell him something, your message will be filed as spam and then deleted, without reply.</p>
<p>Owen is NOT interested in hearing from advertisers looking to promote his work for a fee. He already has his own plans for promotion and if he receives such a message from you, he's likely to pay <em>special</em> attention to it and note the name of your company, to ensure he <em>never</em> does business with you, because you clearly ignored these instructions.</p>
<p>In short, DO NOT send Owen spam of any kind.</p>
