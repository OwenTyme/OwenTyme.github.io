<h1 id="amelia-blackwell">Amelia Blackwell</h1>
<p>Amelia Blackwell is the primary protagonist in the series <a
href="../../books/book-of-newts/index.html">The Book of Newts</a>. She’s
the owner of the magic book that gives the series its name.</p>
<p>She’s a small woman with dirty blond hair that ranges from short to
mid-back, depending on events of the story. She’s Caucasian, with blue
eyes. During the opening scene of <a
href="../../books/book-of-newts/starwitch.html">Starwitch</a>, she’s
about 23 years old.</p>
<p>In general, she’s friendly and helpful to others. It’s extremely rare
for her to not think of others before herself, a habit ingrained into
her during her childhood, by her mother, Erkia Blackwell.</p>
<p>She was raised as a total pacifist by her mother, but over the course
of the first novel, she begins to embrace a more practical philosophy of
using violence only for self-defense and the greater good.</p>
<p>She’s a engineer, with a deep love for building machines of all sorts
and tends to get particularly excited about her projects.</p>
<p>She has a fondness for designing, building and modifying vehicles,
including horseless carriages, a pair of fixed wing airplanes she named
<em>Blackbird</em> and <em>Blackbird II</em>, an airship named
<em>Airwitch</em> and last, but not least, a rocket-style star ship
named <em>Starwitch</em>.</p>
<p>She occasionally dabbles in designing custom weaponry. She also
continually experiments with making new tools of her own design.</p>
<p>Despite the fact she’s clearly a genius, with an incredible mind for
numbers, she’s fairly humble about it, at least until someone tries to
throw legal hurdles in her way. At that point, her habit of voraciously
reading everything she can get her hands on becomes rather terrifying,
because she has a sharp enough intellect to confidently argue about the
law, usually to the detriment of those trying to use it as a hammer to
beat her down.</p>
<p>Amelia is also witch, but her magic powers are extremely weak.
However, she makes up for that by wielding magic with extreme precision.
For example, her range with scrying spells is rather pathetic, reaching
only inches away, but when employing such spells, she can see
microscopic detail.</p>
<p>One of Amelia’s favorite areas of study is enchanting, which allows
her to combine machines with magic, via runes. Her first big success in
this area was a steam engine that used runes to heat water, rather than
a firebox, which made the engine far more compact.</p>
<p>During her time in the militant nation of Dugaria, she was drafted
into the military and forced to become a military contractor, given the
job of developing a war wagon for the King. Instead, Amelia secretly
built <em>Starwitch</em> as the means for her family to escape their
forced military service.</p>
