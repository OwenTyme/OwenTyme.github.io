<h1 id="artemis-watson">Artemis Watson</h1>
<p>Artemis Watson is the protagonist in the series <a
href="../../books/book-of-newts/index.html">Ashen Blades</a>, though
more technically, she has no name.</p>
<p>She has brown hair, extremely blue eyes and an obsession with wearing
the color black. She always wears the top hat she inherited from her
father. She also perpetually wears gloves. For preference, she prefers
elbow-length, fingerless gloves. This might initially seem to be a
stylistic choice, but there are <a href="#psychology">deeply
psychological reasons for this</a>.</p>
<p>She’s a half-demon, half-human girl that was born in 1897, in New
York City. Her mother was a demon witch and her father was a demon
hunter, more specifically an Ashen Blade, which is an organization
dedicated to hunting and eliminating demons on Earth, for the sake of
humanity. This gives her both the powers of a demon and a witch, two
forms of magic that are stronger together.</p>
<p>Artemis looks entirely human at a glance, but that’s only because she
always wears a skirt that hides her tail, which tends to twitch in time
to her mood, much like that of a cat. Combined with the tendency of her
eyes to easily reflect light, a little thought can bring one to the
conclusion she has some traits in common with cats. This is because her
mother had feline traits in demon form, though her demon form was the
size and shape of a regular house cat.</p>
<p>She suffers from a curse from a demon that makes her unable to say
anything other than “It’s a secret”, which tends to really irritate her.
As such, she’s really embraced rude gestures as one of her favorite ways
to communicate.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of demons and the way their true names can be used
to compel them, Artemis was never actually named by her parents and all
the ways that others refer to her are merely nicknames. Personally, she
calls herself ‘the Hunter’, because she considers all demons prey and
has made killing them all her mission in life.</p>
<p>The black market arms dealer she bought her guns from in the 1940’s
gave her the nickname ‘Little Miss Secret’, based on the the only thing
she can say and she was always fond of him, so she loves that nickname.
Her friends often shorten it to just ‘LMS’.</p>
<p>During the third book, she was briefly able to speak her mind and her
private detective partner chose to name her Artemis, rather than calling
her ‘the Hunter’, because that sounded more like a title than a name to
him. Her last name comes from her father, Jake Watson.</p>
<p>Artemis is mischievous, but often cheerful and smiles a lot, at least
when she isn’t angry. Unfortunately, she’s often quite angry. She’s
prone to playing practical jokes, especially with grumpy and serious
people. With demons, her mischievous side becomes extremely cruel,
because she hates them so much.</p>
<p>This is another area in which she takes after a cat and she sometimes
tortures demons to death the way a cat plays with a mouse, though she’s
grown slightly less cruel over time, because demons have sometimes
escaped from her during such moments, leading to her giving them quicker
deaths.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="special-powers">Special Powers</h2>
<p>Artemis has the powers of both a demon and a witch, though she leans
more heavily on her demon powers, because they came with useful
instincts that tell her how to use them.</p>
<p>Her witch powers have been much slower to mature, but so far, she’s
demonstrated fire magic hot enough to produce blue flame and smoke
magic.</p>
<p>Her demon powers give her the ability to teleport between shadows,
extreme physical durability, great strength and super-human speed.
Hypothetically, she’ll also never die of old age.</p>
<p>One of her least favorite powers is the ability to consume demons to
recharge her magical reserves, which is something demons sometimes do to
each other, when they’re feeling peckish. She can’t stand the taste of
them, however.</p>
<p>She combines smoke magic with demon magic to produce solid magical
projections of objects stored in her hat.</p>
<p>The spirit of her mother acts as a living protective spell that that
keeps the world at arms-length from Artemis, unless she chooses to let
someone in.</p>
<p>Anyone that tries to touch her befalls a mysterious, magical accident
brought on by probability manipulation magic. Anyone that intends her
harm tends to experience a deadly accident. Demons are rarely killed by
this effect, due to how durable they are, but it can still be quite
damaging to them.</p>
<p>However, the spell isn’t perfect: indirect attacks and strikes can
hit her.</p>
<p>The spirit of her dead father is bound to her hat, which she
subconsciously turned into a portal to a pocket dimension. Her father
manages manipulating space and sometimes even time for her, extending
the level of control she can exert over the interior of her hat, as well
as the precision with with she can manipulate the contents.</p>
<p>The space inside her hat is fairly large and she once stored an
entire military jeep within it.</p>
<p>Her most powerful magical technique is a combination of witch fire
magic and demonic void magic, which produces what’s known as the
all-consuming flame. This is so hot, it glows in the ultraviolet
spectrum and most anything that’s hit by it is burned to nothingness.
Demons that are struck by this are effectively consumed by Artemis,
giving her a short-term boost to her magic powers.</p>
<p>The all-consuming flame is one of the few ways she knows of to
permanently kill a demon, who normally return to Hell when killed, then
seek to return to Earth.</p>
<h2 id="favored-weapons">Favored Weapons</h2>
<p>Artemis prefers guns that fire .45 rounds, because they have enough
punch to put a hole through a skull, whish is the only way to kill a
demon. She has an M1911 pistol and a Thompson sub-machine gun. The Tommy
gun is her favorite.</p>
<p>In melee, she uses a Japanese wakizashi with a blue hilt wrapping and
a tsuba, or hilt guard, in the shape of an open, blue rose. She often
projects her flame powers onto the blade.</p>
<p>Before she got her first gun, she used a butcher’s knife.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-and-growth-early-life-growth">Early Life and Growth
{#early-life-growth)</h2>
<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"> <img
src="ArtemisWatson-10Years-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson, in 1922" /> </span></p>
<p>At the age of three years old, in the year 1900, her parents were
murdered by a demon in front of her, but due to her mother’s magic,
their spirits were bound to her. Her mother, Annmarie, turned herself
into a living, protective spell.</p>
<p>The father of Artemis was also killed, but his spirit was bound to
his top hat, a favorite item. This is the same top hat Artemis
wears.</p>
<p>Artemis has followed a rather unusual pattern of growth all her life:
she doesn’t grow older until she emotionally matures, then her body
changes fairly instantly, to match her mental state.</p>
<p>For example, when she was twenty-five years old, she looked ten,
because in all that time, she never quite matured enough to progress any
further.</p>
<p>In 1922, she had a chance encounter with a private detective, demon
hunter and Ashen Blade named Reggie Stewart. At the time, she was little
more than a remorseless killing machine that preyed on the demons of New
York City, using a butcher’s knife.</p>
<p>In that first encounter, she stole one of Reggie’s pistols, her very
first gun, which she’s never given up.</p>
<p>Upon leaning of the man’s dangerous job, she began following him and
eventually realized she’d found a kindred spirit. They became partners
and together, they really cleaned up the streets of New York.</p>
<p>While they were together, Artemis matured until she resembled a girl
of fifteen years, though she remained short and petite, at only five
feet tall.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"> <img

title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson, in 1972, during her trip to Vietnam" />
</span></p>
<p>Eventually, in 1942, Reggie was killed and the Ashen Blades assigned
her a new detective partner: Clayton Simmons. She really didn’t mature
much over the next few decades, until the two of them went to Vietnam,
in 1972, to exterminate an arch-demon that had come to Earth.</p>
<p>While they were there, Artermis had a rough experience with the death
of a solider and got human blood on her hands, leading to an emotional
breakdown, but when she eventually recovered, she grew a little
older.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"> <img

title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson at a more mature age" />
</span></p>
<p>In book three, the curse that prevents her from speaking her mind was
briefly lifted and she was able to speak with her father. After that
emotional experience, she once again grew a little older.</p>
<p>In book four, after the loss of a dear friend, the grieving process
finally fully took her into adulthood, because she was forced to discard
some very childish coping mechanisms in order to heal.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="psychology">Psychology</h2>
<p>Due to the hardships of being a half-demon and the trauma Artemis has
experiences, she isn’t exactly mentally stable. In point of fact, she
has multiple personalities.</p>
<p>The first is The Hunter, which is her base personality. The Hunter
represents her ego.</p>
<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"> <img
src="ArtemisWatson-TheDemon-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson in her demonic form" />
</span></p>
<p>The second is her inner demon, which she’s spent a lifetime fighting
to contain, because it’s a murderous creature with no moral compass.
This personality is more or less her Id, an emotional creature with no
self-control.</p>
<p>The one time the inner demon gained full control of their body, she
transformed into a humanoid cat monster absolutely brimming with muscle.
This is more or less the demonic form of Artemis.</p>
<p>In that battle, the demon also publicly declared its name: The Eighth
Deadly Sin, Willful Insanity. She goes by Insanity, for short.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"> <img
src="ArtemisWatson-Alice-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson, as Alice" /> </span></p>
<p>During the climax of book four, Artemis was splashed with
approximately an entire pint of LSD, which resulted in the emergence of
a third personality, which calls herself Alice, due to a song that was
playing at the time (White Rabbit by Jefferson Airplane). Due to how
confused she was at the time, she took on an approximation of the
appearance of Alice from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, blond hair
and all.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p>Quite aside from this, Artemis occasionally hallucinates that she has
blood on her hands, because she was there when Reggie died and got blood
all over them, which is why she wears gloves. This was made worse in
1972, when her gloves got splashed with blood.</p>
<h2 id="travels">Travels</h2>
<p>Artemis hates to travel, because she gets extremely motion sick in
vehicles. However, she has visited a number of places, both in and out
of the United States, including White Sands and Carlsbad Cavern, both in
New Mexico, an undisclosed location that once hosted a summer camp,
California, Kansas, Canada, The Amazon, Egypt, the bottom of the Mariana
trench, Mount Everest, Vietnam, Tokyo in Japan, Alice Springs in
Australia, just possibly Tibet, and a pocket dimension known as The Last
Sanctuary.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Here’s a nice image of Artemis during her brief visit to Tokyo, while
her team was taking a break from fighting the demons hiding in the
jungles of Vietnam. Her clothes went native without her giving it much
thought.</p>

title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson in 1986, when she went to summer camp" />
</span></p>
<p>In 1986, she went undercover at a summer camp that was infested with
demons. At the time, she was pretending to be a teenager, despite the
fact she was old enough to be the grandmother of the teens that
surrounded her. She got particularly cranky while she was there, because
she doesn’t like to interact with teenagers.</p>
