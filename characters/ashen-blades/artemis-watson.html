<h1 id="artemis-watson">Artemis Watson</h1>
<p>Artemis Watson is the protagonist in the series <a
href="../../books/book-of-newts/index.html">Ashen Blades</a>, though
more technically, she has no name.</p>
<p>She has brown hair, extremely blue eyes and an obsession with wearing
the color black. She always wears the top hat she inherited from her
father. She also perpetually wears gloves. For preference, she prefers
elbow-length, fingerless gloves. This might initially seem to be a
stylistic choice, but there are <a href="#psychology">deeply
psychological reasons for this</a>. She is technically a goth, but she
was dressing that way before the term became popular. In her own mind,
she once thought, “Black is where it’s at.”</p>
<p>She’s a half-demon, half-human girl that was born in 1897, in New
York City. Her mother was a demon witch and her father was a demon
hunter, more specifically an Ashen Blade, which is an organization
dedicated to hunting and eliminating demons on Earth, for the sake of
humanity. This gives her both the powers of a demon and a witch, two
forms of magic that are stronger together.</p>
<p>Artemis looks entirely human at a glance, but that’s only because she
always wears a skirt that hides her tail, which tends to twitch in time
to her mood, much like that of a cat. Combined with the tendency of her
eyes to easily reflect light, a little thought can bring one to the
conclusion she has some traits in common with cats. This is because her
mother had feline traits in demon form, though her demon form was the
size and shape of a regular house cat.</p>
<p>She suffers from a curse from a demon that makes her unable to say
anything other than “It’s a secret”, which tends to really irritate her.
As such, she’s really embraced rude gestures as one of her favorite ways
to communicate.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of demons and the way their true names can be used
to compel them, Artemis was never actually named by her parents and all
the ways that others refer to her are merely nicknames. Personally, she
calls herself ‘the Hunter’, because she considers all demons prey and
has made killing them all her mission in life.</p>
<p>The black market arms dealer she bought her guns from in the 1940’s
gave her the nickname ‘Little Miss Secret’, based on the only thing she
can say. She was always fond of him, so she loves that nickname. Her
friends often shorten it to just ‘LMS’.</p>
<p>During the third book, she was briefly able to speak her mind and her
private detective partner chose to name her Artemis, rather than calling
her ‘the Hunter’, because that sounded more like a title than a name to
him. Her last name comes from her father, Jake Watson.</p>
<p>Artemis is mischievous, but often cheerful and smiles a lot, at least
when she isn’t angry. Unfortunately, she’s often quite angry. She’s
prone to playing practical jokes, especially with grumpy and serious
people. With demons, her mischievous side becomes extremely cruel,
because she hates them so much.</p>
<p>This is another area in which she takes after a cat and she sometimes
tortures demons to death the way a cat plays with a mouse, though she’s
grown slightly less cruel over time, because demons have sometimes
escaped from her during such moments, leading to her giving them quicker
deaths as she’s grown more mature.</p>
<p>Like a cat, Artemis is extremely smell-oriented, with an ability to
discern humans from demons by scent. She can also use her heightened
sense of smell to fight blind, which gives her great advantages in a
fight.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="special-powers">Special Powers</h2>
<p>Artemis has the powers of both a demon and a witch, though she leans
more heavily on her demon powers, because they came with useful
instincts that tell her how to use them.</p>
<p>Her witch powers have been much slower to mature, but so far, she’s
demonstrated fire magic hot enough to produce blue flame and smoke
magic.</p>
<p>Her demon powers give her the ability to teleport between shadows,
extreme physical durability, great strength, super-human speed and an
enhanced sense of smell. Hypothetically, she’ll also never die of old
age.</p>
<p>Artemis is fond of combining her ability to teleport with her sense
of smell in the dark, allowing her to teleport from enemy to enemy in a
fashion that leaves her opponents terrified about where she might pop up
next.</p>
<p>One of her least favorite powers is the ability to consume demons to
recharge her magical reserves, which is something demons sometimes do to
each other, when they’re feeling peckish. She can’t stand the taste of
them, however.</p>
<p>She combines smoke magic with demon magic to produce solid magical
projections of objects stored in her hat.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"> <img
src="AnnmarieNossett-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of the mother of Artemis Watson, who&#39;s named Annmarie Nossett" />
</span></p>
<p>The spirit of her mother acts as a living protective spell that that
keeps the world at arms-length from Artemis, unless she chooses to let
someone in.</p>
<p>Anyone that tries to touch her befalls a mysterious, magical accident
brought on by probability manipulation magic. Anyone that intends her
harm tends to experience a deadly accident. Demons are rarely killed by
this effect, due to how durable they are, but it can still be quite
damaging to them.</p>
<p>However, the spell isn’t perfect: indirect attacks and strikes can
hit her.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"> <img
src="JakeWatson-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of the mother of Artemis Watson, who&#39;s named Annmarie Nossett" />
</span></p>
<p>The spirit of her dead father is bound to her hat, which she
subconsciously turned into a portal to a pocket dimension. Her father
manages manipulating space and sometimes even time for her, extending
the level of control she can exert over the interior of her hat, as well
as the precision with with she can manipulate the contents.</p>
<p>The space inside her hat is fairly large and she once stored an
entire military jeep within it.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p>Her most powerful magical technique is a combination of witch fire
magic and demonic void magic, which produces what’s known as the
all-consuming flame. This is so hot, it glows in the ultraviolet
spectrum and most anything that’s hit by it is burned to nothingness.
Demons that are struck by this are effectively consumed by Artemis,
giving her a short-term boost to her magic powers.</p>
<p>The all-consuming flame is one of the few ways she knows of to
permanently kill a demon, who normally return to Hell when killed, then
seek to return to Earth.</p>
<p>She’s encountered many nature spirits over the years, each of which
serves as the avatar of a single element. In 1972, the Wood Spirit (AKA
the Jungle Spirit) picked a fight with her and the end result was
Artemis gaining access to its powers, which gave her the power to
transform into a huge, black cat or to armor her clothing with iron wood
panels, coming to resemble an armored knight with a shield.</p>
<p>She’s since had similar experiences with Water, Air and Metal.</p>
<p>The Water Spirit gave her the power to turn into a massive,
black-skinned shark and other water-related powers she has little use
for, aside from the ability to breathe underwater and survive the
pressure at any depth, which is sometimes handy, since she never did
like using scuba gear.</p>
<p>The Air Spirit gave her the power to control air currents and fly.
She can also create bursts of air in a vacuum or refresh stale air,
which allowed her to breathe on the Moon. Hypothetically, she might be
able to turn into a large, black bird, but she’s never tried to.</p>
<p>The Metal Spirit gave her the power to encase herself in metal at
will and presumably the ability to control metal objects. She once used
its power to cover her clothes in armor plates composed of alternating
layers of titanium and tungsten, for much greater durability than her
iron wood armor, at a mere fraction of the weight.</p>
<h2 id="favored-weapons-and-equipment">Favored Weapons and
Equipment</h2>
<p>Artemis started out using various discarded kitchen knives she
rescued from the trash, with a clear favorite being a full-size
butcher’s knife. These were later supplemented with a baseball bat and
ball. Unfortunately, the ball and bat were destroyed fighting
demons.</p>
<p>In more modern times, Artemis has mostly switched to guns that fire
.45 rounds, because they have enough punch to put a hole through a
skull, which is the only way to kill a demon. She has an M1911 pistol
and a Thompson sub-machine gun. The Tommy gun is her favorite, but due
to the expense of full-auto fire, the rest of the detective agency she
works with have convinced her to use it only when necessary.</p>
<p>She eventually replaced the baseball bat with a Japanese wakizashi
that has a blue hilt wrapping and a tsuba (hilt guard) in the shape of
an open, blue rose. This has so far proven to be durable enough to
withstand her full demonic strength. She often projects her
all-consuming flame onto the blade, which extends her reach.</p>
<p>Here’s the (mostly) untold story of this sword: it was originally a
show piece made to hang on a wall, but the smith that made it still took
the work seriously, because even a decorative weapon might be needed
during a home invasion. The last of its Japanese owners immigrated to
the United States before World War II, but as things became difficult
for Japanese, they needed money and pawned it. When the war got even
more serious, the shop had a hard time selling it and Artemis picked it
up for a bargain price.</p>
<p>When Artemis needs heavier weapons, she has a .50 Browning M2 machine
gun with a shoulder strap to give it a little extra stabilization, which
she’s strong enough to fire from the hip. The few opponents that were
unlucky enough to see this weapon didn’t last long.</p>
<p>Her biggest and most ridiculous weapon is an M168 Vulcan Cannon,
which is normally vehicle mounted, but she can just barely manage to
fire it from the hip, though she isn’t very accurate with it, because
it’s just too big. On the other hand, considering the rate of fire that
thing is capable of, she tends to spray and pray. She mostly keeps it
for the sake of her gun collection, rather than considering it a useful
weapon, though a small number of demons have been on the receiving end
of it, on occasions when she <em>really</em> lost her temper. She rarely
has ammunition for it, because the bullets are not available at sane
prices.</p>
<p>Her top hat is one of her most prized possessions, because it
belonged to her father. It contains a pocket dimension, which holds all
of her other possessions and serves as the home of her mother’s
familiar, Mashu’ra, a juvenile demon in the form of a kitten. Mashu’ra
serves Artemis by looking after and caring for her weapons, including
reloading her guns, though no one is quite sure how a kitten manages
that.</p>
<p>In 1972, the Wood Spirit (AKA Jungle Spirit) gave Artemis some magic
clothes that change shape at a whim and are durable enough to act as
light body armor that can stop bullets. They also clean and repair
themselves. They can take on just about any style, including useful
forms like a space suit or hazmat gear.</p>
<p>In 1986, the Water Spirit gave her a shark-tooth necklace that really
doesn’t match her usual style of accessories, but she <em>does</em>
reluctantly wear it. It hasn’t yet displayed any magical abilities, but
it may in the future.</p>
<p>In 2024, the Air Spirit gave her a decorative, silver comb, which
came with the incidental power to alter her hair style and color at
will. She uses it to change her hair color as her mood changes, or as
her twisted and black sense of fashion dictates. She tends to pick
somber colors that match her goth-like persona, including blue, when she
was depressed. However, when Alice emerged and took control of their
body, her hair turned blond (see the section on <a
href="#psychology">Psychology</a> for more information).</p>
<p>Also in 2024, the Metal Spirit gave her a bracelet with black,
cast-iron plates linked by stainless steel chain. It hasn’t yet
displayed any magical abilities, but it may in the future. She isn’t one
for jewelry, but she does like this accessory, since the Metal Spirit
was wise enough to recognize her sense of style, unlike the Water
Spirit.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-growth">Early Life and Growth</h2>
<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"> <img
src="ArtemisWatson-10Years-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson, in 1922" /> </span></p>
<p>At the age of three years old, in the year 1900, her parents were
murdered by a demon in front of her, but due to her mother’s magic,
their spirits were bound to her. Her mother, Annmarie, turned herself
into a living, protective spell.</p>
<p>The father of Artemis was also killed, but his spirit was bound to
his top hat, a favorite item. This is the same top hat Artemis
wears.</p>
<p>Artemis has followed a rather unusual pattern of growth all her life:
she doesn’t grow older until she emotionally matures, then her body
changes fairly instantly, to match her mental state.</p>
<p>For example, when she was twenty-five years old, she looked ten,
because in all that time, she never quite matured enough to progress any
further.</p>
<p>In 1922, she had a chance encounter with a private detective, demon
hunter and Ashen Blade named Reggie Stewart. At the time, she was little
more than a remorseless killing machine that preyed on the demons of New
York City, using a butcher’s knife.</p>
<p>In that first encounter, she stole one of Reggie’s pistols, her very
first gun, which she’s never given up.</p>
<p>Upon learning of the man’s dangerous job, she began following him and
eventually realized she’d found a kindred spirit. They became partners
and together, they really cleaned up the streets of New York.</p>
<p>While they were together, Artemis matured until she resembled a girl
of fifteen years, though she remained short and petite, at only five
feet tall.</p>
<p>Eventually, in 1942, Reggie was killed and the Ashen Blades assigned
her a new detective partner: Clayton Simmons.</p>

title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson, in 1972, during her trip to Vietnam" />
</span></p>
<p>She really didn’t mature much over the next few decades, until the
two of them went to Vietnam, in 1972, to exterminate an arch-demon that
had come to Earth.</p>
<p>While they were there, Artermis had a rough experience with the death
of a solider and got human blood on her hands, leading to an emotional
breakdown, but when she eventually recovered, she grew a little
older.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"> <img
src="ArtemisWatson-17Years-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson at a more mature age" />
</span></p>
<p>In book three, the curse that prevents her from speaking her mind was
briefly lifted and she was able to speak with her father. After that
emotional experience, she once again grew a little older.</p>
<p>In book four, after the loss of a dear friend, the grieving process
finally fully took her into adulthood, because she was forced to discard
some very childish coping mechanisms in order to heal.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<h2 id="psychology">Psychology</h2>
<p>Due to the hardships of being a half-demon and the trauma Artemis has
experienced, she isn’t exactly mentally stable. In point of fact, she
has multiple personalities.</p>
<p>The first is The Hunter, which is her base personality. The Hunter
represents her ego.</p>
<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"> <img
src="ArtemisWatson-TheDemon-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson in her demonic form" />
</span></p>
<p>The second is her inner demon, which she’s spent a lifetime fighting
to contain, because this personality is a murderous creature with no
moral compass. The demon is more or less her Id, an emotional creature
with no self-control.</p>
<p>The one time the demon gained full control of their body, she
transformed into a humanoid cat monster absolutely brimming with muscle,
which is more or less the demonic form of Artemis.</p>
<p>In that battle, the demon also publicly declared its name: The Eighth
Deadly Sin, Willful Insanity. She goes by Insanity, for short.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, Insanity was born the day Reggie Stewart was killed,
because Artemis completely lost control of herself, only coming to her
senses after the mixed group of demons and humans was defeated, with the
humans fleeing, while the demons were…extremely dead, with evidence of
claws and teeth.</p>
<p>Reggie witnessed the incident before he died and spoke as if he was
impressed, but Artemis has no memory of it.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, Insanity has a fondness for Jake, their father.</p>
<p>Insanity and the Hunter have a rather unusual relationship, in that
they hate and love each other, but neither of them would have it any
other way. When they face outside threats to their mind, like telepathic
attacks, they usually face them together, despite the way Insanity
insists she’ll someday eat the Hunter.</p>
<p>What it comes down to is a matter of predator and prey dynamics, in
which Insanity has claimed the Hunter as prey, so Insanity refuses to
let anyone else kill her.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p><span class="book-cover-right" style="max-width: 400px;"> <img
src="ArtemisWatson-Alice-AnimeStyle.jpg"
title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson, as Alice" /> </span></p>
<p>During the climax of book four, Artemis was splashed with
approximately an entire pint of LSD, which resulted in the emergence of
a third personality, who calls herself Alice, due to a song that was
playing at the time (<em>White Rabbit</em>, by Jefferson Airplane). Due
to how confused she was at the time, she took on an approximation of the
appearance of Alice from <em>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</em>,
blond hair and all.</p>
<p>Alice cares for the Hunter like a sister and has demonstrated a
tendency to side with her against Insanity, helping to keep the demon
under control.</p>
<div style="clear: both;">

</div>
<p>Quite aside from this, Artemis occasionally hallucinates that she has
blood on her hands, because she was there when Reggie died and got blood
all over them, which is why she wears gloves. This hallucination got
worse in 1972, when her gloves got splashed with blood.</p>
<p>When Artemis gets tremendously angry, beyond merely losing her
temper, her eyes glow. This is part of her demonic ancestry, though it
is exceptionally rare.</p>
<h2 id="travels">Travels</h2>
<p>Artemis hates to travel, because she gets extremely motion sick in
vehicles. However, she has visited a number of places, both in and out
of the United States, including White Sands and Carlsbad Cavern, both in
New Mexico, The Cauldron of the Elements (a remote volcanic caldera
somewhere in the United States, which once hosted a summer camp),
California, Kansas, Canada, The Amazon, Egypt, the bottom of the Mariana
trench, Mount Everest, Vietnam, Tokyo in Japan, Alice Springs in
Australia, a snowy mountainside that may have been in Tibet, the Moon,
and a pocket dimension known as The Last Sanctuary.</p>

title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson in a kimono, in 1972" />
</span></p>
<p>Here’s a nice image of Artemis during her brief visit to Tokyo, while
her team was taking a break from fighting the demons hiding in the
jungles of Vietnam. On this occasion, her magic clothes went native
without her giving it much thought.</p>

title="An AI-generated image of Artemis Watson in 1986, when she went to summer camp" />
</span></p>
<p>In 1986, she went undercover at a summer camp that was infested with
demons. At the time, she was pretending to be a teenager, despite the
fact she was old enough to be the grandmother of the teens that
surrounded her. She got particularly cranky while she was there, because
she doesn’t like to interact with teenagers.</p>
