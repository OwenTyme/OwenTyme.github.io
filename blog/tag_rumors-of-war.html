<p>This is part two of my series on my work in progress novel, <a href="../books.html#troll-war">Troll War</a>, which centers around a kingdom of trolls going to war with a kingdom of dwarves, all because a pair of corrupt nobles from a third kingdom were bored and curious to see which race would come out on top.</p>

<p>You can read <a href="../books.html#troll-war">a short description of Troll War</a> to learn more or you can read <a href="https://mastodon.social/@OwenTyme/112672253855096568">short summaries of each day's writing, on Mastodon</a>.  This series can be read <a href="tag_rumors-of-war.html">via this link</a>, though it will be in reverse chronological order, from newest to oldest.</p>

<p>Writing was fun this week, with a fair amount of action as the fighting between the dwarves and trolls heated up, followed by the start of a little romantic subplot that will be rather important to later chapters.  I also planted some important seeds for later plot points.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5: The Bleeding Mother</h2>

<p>I renamed Chapter 5 based on what I wrote on Monday (July 1).</p>

<p>Anji, the troll Weapon Master, and Nepita's sister, Illa, a powerful witch, lurk in the forest on the other side of Razorpoint Ridge, while Illa practices an ancient troll song, titled <em>Flowing Stone</em>.  The song is extremely complex, but holds the power to wake the earth itself.  She completes the work and masters the difficult pronunciation.</p>

<p>As dawn comes, the trolls prepare to attack and Illa starts the magical song.  It normally requires a soprano, an alto and a tenor, all working together, taking turns to sing the song, but Illa is able to sing all of it, except the deepest notes at the very beginning.  Anji, as a natural tenor, helps her sing that portion and then leads the army to attack Razorpoint Refuge.</p>

<p>The song describes the earth as a pregnant mother, giving birth to her child (ash and smoke), effectively comparing lava to blood.  The song-based spell causes lava to pour into the deep coal mines of the dwarf fort, effectively filling it up from the inside, while frightened dwarves flee, most of them killed by the catastrophe!</p>

<p>King Windmaker, of the dwarves, is horrified to see his fears come to fruition as the seemingly impregnable fortress falls to magic, just as a screaming army of trolls comes around the ridge to attack!</p>

<p>At the same time, Illa passes out, because she misjudged the energy requirements of the spell, having gone far beyond her personal limits.  Fortunately, that means that instead of turning the whole mountain into an active volcano, it stops at just producing a large pool of lava spilling out of the fort's front gates.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6: Withermine</h2>

<p>Chapter 7 was actually written first, because inspiration struck me regarding the conclusion of the conflict at Razorpoint Refuge, but I often switch back and forth to different locations in my writing and I'll try to keep things simple on this blog by going in story order, here.</p>

<p>Most of the chapter follows Captain Shatterhand, the female dwarf officer in charge of the war-riders headed for Withermine.</p>

<p>Her unit is lost in fog that's settled in around the remote mining village and she's convinced they've been going in circles for hours on end.</p>

<p>There's a brief internal monologue about the swamp, which is filled with mythril deposits.  This section is designed to aid the reader's understanding of dwarven enchantment techniques and why mythril is so important to them.</p>

<p>Mythril acts as a natural magical purifier/concentrator, taking in the raw magic of the air, only to release it in a more pure and reactive form.  Magic effectively pools around it, building up over time until someone comes near, at which point the magic responds to their thoughts, producing randomized, chaotic spell-like bursts the dwarves call 'mythril surges'.</p>

<p>Dwarven enchantments normally consist of a small amount of mythril (an ounce or two) to serve as a power source for the magic, combined with dwarven runes, which act like an analog to an electrical circuit, transforming the raw magic the mythril produces into a more controlled, useful form.  Dwarven runes are effectively another form of natural magic, but they require the skill of an exceptional smith to do anything on their own.  An exceptional smith working with mythril can produce very powerful results, that var in direct proportion to how much mythril is used.</p>

<p>Shatterhand wishes their compasses would work, but one of the natural side effects of uncontrolled mythril makes compass needles spin.</p>

<p>She stops at some trees to determine north from the moss on the trunks, but there's moss on all sides.  However, she does see a wither-like blight in the leaves of the tree, marking their proximity to Withermine, because the trees are sick with toxic mythril poisoning.</p>

<p>One of her men, who has an excellent sense of direction, volunteers his opinion they should take a sharp turn left.  For lack of any better idea, she puts the dwarf in the lead.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the trolls waiting to ambush Withermine have been camping on a large island near their target.  Their leader, Aketa, hears the dwarven war-riders approaching, because the legs of them splash rather loudly.</p>

<p>She wakes her sister, Kina, ordering the woman to mask their presence with an illusion, while the trolls all press themselves into the rocks of the island.  Aketa takes position on a high rock, to give herself a good view, while Kina sings, causing them to visually meld into the rocks, masked with mental trickery.  Her singing comes to resemble a natural wind blowing through rocks, but since there's no wind, it sounds eerie and ghost-like.</p>

<p>Hearing the song and mistaking it for something caused by a mythril surge, Shatterhand advises her men to keep their thoughts focused on the mundane, to avoid danger, because the form of a surge is only limited by the imagination.</p>

<p>Shatterhand spots the island and cautiously marches her men and their war-riders onto it, finding some half-rotted bedding scattered about (the bedding of just the troll leaders, because most of the men have been doing without).  After a brief discussion, the dwarves conclude some adventurers likely got lost in the swamp and used the island as a temporary refuge, before dying off to the dangers of the place.</p>

<p>Shatterhand orders her men to inspect their war-riders for damage, while she spends her time tying to use the island to figure out which way north is, because though the island is on her map, she still isn't sure which way to go.</p>

<p>Kina turns her song into a lullaby, putting the dwarves to sleep, while Aketa stalks Shatterhand.  There's a brief fight in which Shatterhand refuses to back down and Aketa cuts the dwarf's throat.  While Shatterhand struggles to breathe in her dying moments, Aketa telepathically enters her mind, stealing knowledge of both Shatterhand's orders and how to drive a war-rider.</p>

<p>Withermine is wiped out with ease (off-screen, so to speak, since it doesn't really matter) and the trolls decide to use the war-riders to fool King Windmaker into trusting them. They head off to Flintbrook, where the dwarves are planning to rendezvous before heading into troll lands, to assault the Utros palace.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7: Hired Assassin</h2>

<p>The battle at Razorpoint Ridge is short, but intense.</p>

<p>King Windmaker initially struggles against the trolls, because there's thousands of them that swarm him en-masse, trying to climb all over his war-rider!  He spins in place, flinging them off, just in time for Anji to land on top of his war machine.  He tries to swat her with his war-rider's ax, but she's too fast, using her sickles to hook the sides of the rear hatch.</p>

<p>She uses her weapons to cut through the latch holding it closed and then flips her way onto the hatch like a ninja!  At the same time, King Windmaker snatches an ax off the wall of the cockpit and whirls around, aiming to cut her down!  Her wickedly-sharp sickles cut the head of the ax free, followed by cutting the handle from the shaft, leaving the king effectively unarmed.</p>

<p>She places her weapons to his throat and the king feigns surrender.  He knows what she doesn't, however: her sickles are dwarf made and in fact, his very own creations, which he gave to the troll king as a gesture of peace.  Dwarf made enchanted weapons normally will not harm the smith that made them, nor will they harm the king of the dwarves, so he punches Anji as hard as he can, shattering her nose!</p>

<p>She reacts by trying to cut his throat, but the sickles lose their sharpness, unable to do more than merely bruise him!  Anji starts to fall back, but the King refuses to let her escape, grabbing both of her wrists, using them to haul her in close, for a devastating head-butt that cracks her skull!</p>

<p>The King thinks Anji is a hired assassin, based on her attire and figure.  She wears blood-red clothing and armor, which marks her as a member of the <em>Sanguine Sisterhood</em>, a notorious band of supposedly human women that work as expensive hired killers.  However, he doesn't know the full truth; the <em>Sanguine Sisterhood</em> have always been troll women.</p>

<p>He decides to offer her payment, putting a bounty on the head of the troll king, Shengis, literally offering both a hefty sum of gold and enchanted weaponry to the assassin that produces the troll's head.</p>

<p>Anji agrees and King Windmaker tosses her broken body to the ground, with little expectation she'll survive her wounds, because he thinks she's human.</p>

<p>The battle is finished, with the troll army wiped out, but the victory is pyrrhic, since no one from the fort survived the melee.</p>

<p>Anji drags herself home, discovering along the way that the dwarves have found and captured Illa, though they actually think she was a prisoner of the trolls that were guarding her in her sleep.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8: False Riders</h2>

<p>King Windmaker and his men lurk in the ruins of Flinrbrook, horrified by the message the trolls left him, spelled out with dwarf corpses: <em>THE PRICE IS TEN-FOLD!</em></p>

<p>He knows the troll policy of responding with ten-fold force to any offense and even has no issue with it, knowing the enemies of Utros to the west, consisting of goblins and dark fairies, need a harsh hand, just to bring them to the negotiating table.</p>

<p>However, he doesn't understand the message, because he knows of no offense deserving of troll retribution, convinced the war began as a misunderstanding, though he knows it's already too late to stop the fighting.</p>

<p>As he's puzzled about the message, Aketa's troll-driven war-riders arrive, marching as if on parade in a city, rather than a more natural marching gait useful for crossing the wilderness, which makes no sense.  In addition, their leader is singing a dwarven song of triumph, leaving him wondering if they're drunk.</p>

<p>Putting the pieces together in his mind, he screams for his men to plug their ears and attack, leading to a desperate melee between war machines!</p>

<p>King Windomaker seeks the enemy leader in the midst of the brawl, eventually spotting the silver decorations of Captain Shatterhand's personal war-rider.</p>

<p>He shield-rushes her from behind, damaging her escape hatch and they both go down.  Getting a war-rider on its feet after a fall isn't easy and King Windmaker is the only one to have mastered performing an acrobatic stand in one, getting his war machine back on its feet nearly instantly, while Aketa is forced to move more slowly.</p>

<p>Halfway through raising her war-rider's torso, the king's ax smashes through her window, while she dodges, inside her cockpit!  The ax smashes through the cockpit and into the steam chamber, below, releasing super-heated steam that burns every inch of Aketa's body!</p>

<p>Knowing she'll never heal properly, due to the weakness of trolls to being burned, she goes all-in on a suicide attack, using the King's backward yank of his ax to free it as the means to launch herself at his cockpit window, aiming her sword for his eye!</p>

<p>She smashes through the glass, but her weapon betrays her, pulling to one side of its own accord!  She lands on the King, who head-butts her, cracking her skull, before he grabs her sword and beheads her!</p>

<p>He kicks her body out the window and then sets his war-rider to slowly turn in place, holding Aketa's head up for all to see as he shows the trolls he's taken their leader's head and demands their surrender.</p>

<p>They back down and the battle is won.</p>

<p>Kina watches the battle via a telescope while she hides with the remainder of the troll forces (there weren't enough war-riders for all of them).</p>

<p>While the dwarves are distracted with their prisoners, Kina retrieves her sister and holds the head in place, so Aketa doesn't actually die.  In wasn't sisterly love that motivated her, but rather duty to the Queen.</p>

<p>Aketa is carried back by the men and Kina drives their only remaining war-rider back to the Utros mountains, so they can report on the unexpected capabilities of the dwarves and give her the captured war machine, for study.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9: The Icy Maiden</h2>

<p>Illa wakes in a dwarf hospital in the palace of their capital city, Wind Hammer.  Kadrek is in the bed beside her own and is totally infatuated with her, because she's very attractive.</p>

<p>Knowing she's too weak to get home on her own, she plays the femme fatale and leans into his attraction, pretending to be the daughter of a human gunsmith, who was killed by the trolls.  She hopes to recover her strength and then magically brainwash Kadrek, that he might carry supplies for her on the way home, ultimately planning to give him to Nepita as a hostage.</p>

<p>The dwarf reminds Illa of her first love, who was murdered by Nepita for being a rather out-spoken male (at great risk to his life, he pursued Illa, rather than the other way around).</p>

<p>Over the course of days, they speak at length, the friendship between them grows and Illa starts to lose herself to the role she's taken on, because Kadrek really has grown to love her and she's begun to feel the same.</p>

<p>Kadrek has the healers take them to the surface in wheelchairs and there, he gets on his feet.  It's obvious that standing on his injured feet is like walking on daggers for him.  He flexes his muscles in the sun and Illa's heart beats faster!</p>

<p>Illa mentally reminds herself in a somewhat shaky fashion, <em>He’s a means to an end.  He’s a means to an end!  My gosh, he’s an</em> attractive <em>means to an end!</em></p>

<p>Seeing her expression, he winks and flexes his bicep, showing off.  She finds her will weakening, but dredges up some pride in her trollish heritage to fight back with, reminding herself that she's of royal blood, sister to the Queen and the greatest witch Utros has seen in five-hundred years.</p>

<p>Kadrek asks her if she wants to dance and Illa is overcome by the romance of it: he's in serious pain, but still wants to dance with her!</p>

<p>In one final attempt to cling to her cold, icy heart, she (truthfully) tells him she's too weak to stand.</p>

<p>He offers to support both their weight and the last of the ice in Illa's heart melts, allowing a metaphorical avalanche of released ice and water to bury her trollish pride, once and for all, falling head over heels for the charming dwarf.</p>

<p>She agrees and Kadrek picks her up, supporting her weight, despite his injured feet, seemingly oblivious to the pain, because he's holding the woman he loves as he slowly bobs from foot to foot.</p>

<p>Illa makes up her mind to tell him the truth, but knows the time isn't right.  She fears it's too soon and she'll be killed for who she really is.  She leans into her feelings and pushes their relationship forward by kissing Kadrek as passionately as she knows how, because she needs him to fall head over heels for her.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10: Exile</h2>

<p>Finally well enough to leave the hospital, Illa is put in a cottage on the palace grounds set aside for elf visitors.  The interior is decorated with wood furniture carved with leafy patterns.  The bed has green sheets and pillows.  Light streams in through a colorful, stained-glass window.</p>

<p>She sits on the edge of the bed, wearing a blue, silk dress the same shade as her eyes, which was originally made for a dwarf, though it was expertly cut down to fit her very slender frame by the palace seamstress.  Her legs are a little long for it, leaving it hanging at mid-calf height, but that's just fine, because that's the current fashion among human women.  Her hair is tied back with a matching scarf.</p>

<p>Kadrek arrives, dressed in a red tunic and matching felt hat, with a shiny, mythril belt buckle that emanates heavy magic.</p>

<p>The plan is for the two of them to spend a day walking around town, because they're both finally well enough for it.</p>

<p>That's as far as I got for the week, but I know how the chapter will end. The King has returned to the city with troll prisoners, who will recognize Illa and try to get her to help them, blowing her cover.</p>

<p>Kadrek will defend Illa with his life, taking up arms against the King's men.  The two of them will be captured and hauled before the King, who will hear their stories.  Illa will finally come clean and Kadrek will continue to stand with her.</p>

<p>Unable to bring himself to kill his son's beloved, the King will instead disown Kadrek, marry them on the spot, then exile them from the kingdom, likely giving Kadrek the parting gift of a fat purse filled with gold, that they might make their way to Oswil, where they're sure to be accepted.</p>

<p>Eight days ago, I started work on one of my many planned novels, <a href="../books.html#troll-war">Troll War</a></p>

<p>For a while now, I've been thinking it might be fun to write a little something about each day's writing, as a sort of journal of my work in progress.</p>

<p>I'll be doing this on Mastodon for daily posts and on this blog for more in-depth information every weekend.</p>

<p>To start the ball rolling, I've been posting my daily updates on Mastodon all week: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@OwenTyme/112672253855096568">https://mastodon.social/@OwenTyme/112672253855096568</a></p>

<p>These are each short, normally detailing one chapter, because that's roughly my minimum average output.  From time to time I may post twice in a day, if I've done things that need to be broken up.</p>

<p>The rest of this post will be my first weekly update.</p>

<h2>Basics of the Setting</h2>

<p>Troll War takes place in a galaxy not unlike our own, on a world similar to Earth, though with the addition of magic.  It won't play too big a part in the novel, but there's a whole galaxy of sci-fi wonders out there, including an AI species that's consuming the resources of the galaxy to spread like a plague, but that won't become a big part of the story until book 2, <a href="../books.html#ai-war">AI War</a>.</p>

<p>The series is titled <a href="../books.html#rumors-of-war">Rumors of War</a>.</p>

<p>This as yet unnamed world (the inhabitants probably call their planet some uncreative translation of the word 'dirt', just like we do) includes a variety of fantasy races.  So far, I've only mentioned humans, elves, dwarves, trolls, gnomes, goblins and dark fairies (but this implies the inclusion of light fairies).  The other races will likely play a part in book 3, <a href="../books.html#magic-war">Magic War</a>.</p>

<p>As for technological level, I'm intentionally breaking with tradition and not using a medieval setting, placing the people of the various races collectively somewhat beyond the Victorian-era of technology, with a fantastic flare, but only when considered as a homogeneous people, which they most certainly are not.</p>

<h3>Dwarves</h3>

<p>The dwarves have advanced steam technology and metallurgy, including vehicles and trains of all kind, but have stuck by their old melee weapons, shields and armor, because the best firearms they've managed on their own are muskets, though they don't know the secret to making black powder or gunpowder, getting that from humans.  Their axes do include one-shot muskets, however, in place of the ax handle.</p>

<p>Dwarves don't use magic directly, but their best craftsmen are somewhat mysteriously able to craft magic items and their magic is always of the best quality.  They do this by starting with magical materials they've dug from the ground, such as mythril.</p>

<h3>Humans</h3>

<p>The humans are most advanced in firearms and the family of Lady Gunn (see below) are the principle inventors of guns.  In particular, repeating pistols and rifles will play a part in battle later in the book, once things really get going.</p>

<h3>Elves</h3>

<p>Elves mostly eschew technology in favor of magic, but they have nothing against purchasing technological items from other races, if they find them useful.  This may change over time or it may not.  I'm undecided, but the local elves in the book are very much linked to the humans, since they're governed by the same king.</p>

<h3>Trolls</h3>

<p>Trolls are surprisingly advanced in medicine, because they have the advantage of being able to experiment with bodies that rapidly regenerate and the real truth is that their doctors (if you could call them that!) are able to produce frightening abominations of biology that would terrify even modern men, shaping the bodies of trolls until they become something new and horrifying.</p>

<p>It isn't uncommon for a troll to reattach severed limbs and with the assistance of another, they can reattach a severed head.</p>

<p>It isn't obvious to an outsider, but troll women look just like human women, aside from being exceptionally attractive, with starkly-white hair.</p>

<p>Troll women are all effectively witches, with a style of music-based magic unique to them.  They prefer, but are not limited to mental magic, with a heavy emphasis on telepathy.  Illusions come almost as easy to them.</p>

<p>Trolls strongly believe that might makes right.  They're secretly ruled by their women, because their magic makes them believe they're superior to men and the men have never been strong enough to resist.</p>

<h3>Notable Kingdoms</h3>

<p>Oswil is the human/elf kingdom, to the north of the main trade road.  The southern end of the kingdom is human land and the north end is elf land, though they all live under the rule of a human king.</p>

<p>To the southwest of Oswil is Utros, the troll kingdom, which is outwardly ruled by King Shengis, though he's actually a puppet of the troll Queen, Nepita.  Utros is mostly in the mountains and the land is rich with iron.</p>

<p>To the southeast of Oswil is Fortune Fields, the dwarf kingdom, which is mostly a large, open plain, though there are swamps and mountains on the western edge.  The land is rich with copper, iron, silver and gold.</p>

<p>The three kingdoms form the primary setting of <a href="../books.html#troll-war">Troll War</a>.</p>

<h2>Prologue</h2>

<p>The majority of the prologue was written as a result of some inspiration about five months ago and on Friday of last week (the 21st), I did some clean-up work and then finished it.</p>

<p>This initial scene takes place in a tavern on the southern outskirts of the human kingdom of Oswil, which hosts bare knuckle matches with very few rules.</p>

<p>On this particular day, a human noblewoman, Lady Gunn, has been invited to join another noble, an elf wizard named Lord Rolar.  Lady Gunn isn't pleased by how dirty the tavern is, but she's pleased by the fine wine her companion offers her and a match between a dwarf and a troll begins.</p>

<p>Dwarves are well-known for how sturdy they are, on top of being incredibly stubborn.  Their fighting spirit is second to none and getting a dwarf to back down is next to impossible.  This particular dwarf is used to slowly wearing his opponents down by having far greater endurance, on top of being able to punch like a fully-loaded mine cart.</p>

<p>Trolls, on the other hand, have the wondrous power to regenerate from most any wound, a power they use to out-last most any opponent they might face in battle.  This particular troll is used to taking hits and growing back, outlasting his opponents though masochism and an incredible tolerance for pain.</p>

<p>Lady Gunn is soon drawn into the fight, selecting the dwarf as her choice of champion to cheer for.</p>

<p>The one-on-one fight rages for six hours, until the dwarf is exhausted, but still standing and the troll is on his feet, but he's begun to exhaust his body's resources useful for regeneration, starting to lose his edge though hunger.</p>

<p>The tiny thought I had in the back of my mind for this is that each time a troll heals, they become slightly more hungry.  While they're able to recycle damaged cells and restore their bodies, there's a lasting cost in the form of a metabolic price that must be paid to activate the magic used for this.</p>

<p>Both combatants are at the end of their rope, breathing heavily and the troll isn't regenerating anymore, because he's too hungry.  They nod to each other with mutual respect.</p>

<p>The dwarf asks, "Shall we end this by putting everything we've got into one last exchange?"</p>

<p>The troll agrees and they both abandon defense, charging each other for one, final strike!  The troll dies as a result and the dwarf is briefly praised as the winner, but just as he starts a speech about his victory, he falls dead, min-sentence.</p>

<p>Seeing the results, Lord Rolar asks, "To the south of Oswil, we have two nations, Fortune Fields and Utros, ruled by dwarves and trolls, respectively.  After this evening's spectacle, can you imagine what might happen if circumstances conspired to send them to war?"</p>

<p>Lady Gunn proposes they settle the question with their usual bet at stake: thirty silver pieces.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: Don't Kill the Messenger!</h2>

<p>Nepita, Queen of the Trolls sits upon her throne in the great hall of Utros, surrounded by the women of her court, feeling bored.</p>

<p>He thoughts are interrupted by a nervous boy entering the room, carrying a message from the troll king, Shengis, claiming an elf has been captured entering the kingdom.</p>

<p>Nepita invited the boy to come closer and realizes she's looking at her own son, who she handed off to her mate to raise, once he was weaned.  She feels a strangely sudden sense of attachment to the fourteen year old boy and grants him the title of 'Prince', similar to the way she granted her mate the title of 'King'.  She orders her right-hand woman, Anji, the Weapon Master, to take the boy away for training, then orders her sister, Illa, to test the boy for magic potential, which flies in the face of tradition.</p>

<p>Nepita silences the resulting argument with a thunderous shout and then orders the room cleared.  She may have a sentimental side, but Nepita is also unpredictable and beyond deadly.  She respected by the entire court due to the way she broke every bone in her grandmother's body, to gain the throne.  She's also well-known for revisiting any offense ten-fold, which is her standing international policy.</p>

<p>Raising her voice in song, Nepita touches the mind of her mate, Shengis, that she might use him like a puppet.</p>

<p>Through his eyes, she observes the elf prisoner, who explains his presence by offering up a journal taken from an ill-fated party of dwarves that had been on a spying mission inside troll lands.</p>

<p>It is hinted, but not spelled out that this elf is Lord Rolar, last seenin the prologue.</p>

<p>Nepita speed-reads the journal and is both furious with the dwarves and eager for war, because it will interrupt her boredom.</p>

<p>Disconnecting her mind from Shengis, she calls Anji back into the room, giving orders for the coming conflict.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: Disturbing the Peace</h2>

<p>King Gorgo Windmaker, the Tenth, King of the kingdom of Fortune Fields, receives a guest.</p>

<p>Lady Gunn hands over a journal she claims was captured from trolls, which details their spying operation and observations of the dwarf kingdom.</p>

<p>King Windmaker values his profitable business relationship and even friendship with the trolls, despite their obvious differences, but he can't ignore the journal, so he sends his son, Prince Kadrek, as an envoy to Utros, to seek a peaceful conclusion to the conflict.</p>

<p>The price has an eerie journey up the canyon leading to the palace of Utros, until he hears singing that absolutely entrances him, drawing him every forward, until he lays eyes on four troll women.  He stares at them in a trace as his men are slaughtered, but just as he's about to be killed, their leader, Anji, recognizes him, having sen the Prince though her mate's eyes.</p>

<p>She orders the prince stripped, shaved and his memory of troll women wiped, then sends him on ahead, for interrogation.  The Prince is put to sleep by a magic lullaby.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: Declaration of War</h2>

<p>When Kadrek wakes, he faces Shengis and Nepita looks on him through her mate's eyes.</p>

<p>He explains his presence and begs for peace, but neither of the troll rulers believes him, thinking his father sent him under false pretenses.</p>

<p>They hear him out, then give him an ultimatum to deliver, before giving him the night to rest, because eh it's a long, naked, barefoot run back to the palace of Fortune Fields, which he should make sure he hurries to complete, because he has limited time to warn his father before two more villages are destroyed (he's informed of the plan to destroy Flintbrook; see next paragraph).</p>

<p>While the prince sleeps, Anji and her army arrive at the smallest dwarf village along the border to Utros, Flintbrook.  They slaughter every dwarf they find, not even sparing the children, and arrange the bodies to spell out a horrifying message: <em>THE PRICE IS TEN-FOLD!</em>  They leave no stone of the village standing on another, using bursts of magic to level every structure they find.</p>

<p>At dawn, the prince is released and he runs the entire way, leaving his feet a bleeding mess.  He collapses in the throne room and tells his father he must immediately respond with his acceptance of the destruction of Flintbrook or be prepared to lose Withermine and Razorpoint Refuge, followed by all-out war.</p>

<p>Last of all, he warns his father the soldiers should plug their ears and not listen to the singing, before he passes out.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4: War Machine</h2>

<p>Furious, King Windmaker shouts, "By Nobris, <em>ye don't shave a dwarf's beard!</em>"</p>

<p>Here's a helpful quote from what I've written, to explain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nobris was the god of dwarves, industry and beards, who was widely believed to have gifted the dwarf race with their talent for mining and crafting.  According to legend, he’d also given them their beards, which grew thicker and longer than the hair of women.  To a dwarf, their very beard was a sacred, god-given gift and shaving it off was said to be an affront to Nobris, whom they praised more than any other god.  In short, the trolls hadn’t just shamed the prince, but they’d also insulted Nobris.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kadrek is carried off by the healers, while the King erupts in orders to prepare his kingdom for war.  In particular, he orders his war-riders gathered at the west gate, then makes his way to the back of a statue set behind his throne, climbing a ladder to the platform, which allows access to the interior of the statue, which is filled with buttons, levers and other controls.  He opens the shutters covering the windshield of the definitely-not-a-statue, allowing more light in, then shuts the back hatch.</p>

<p>He activates the steam engine in the belly of his war-rider, which is actually a huge, steam-powered mech shaped like a giant dwarf armed with an ax and shield.  Likewise, the war-riders occupied by his royal guardsmen come to life and they march down the hall, though a huge pair of brass-shod doors.</p>

<p>They emerge on the main street of the royal city and every dwarf witnesses the huge machines in motion, coming to the same conclusion: the kingdom is at war.  The workers on their way home from work turn around to volunteer for another shift, while the busy streets are soon cleared, as every man, woman and child among the dwarves sets out to contribute to the war effort, as one lone street vendor, who used to be a royal guardsman sheds a tear for the looming future and the loss of peace, likely with the only joy being the joy of fighting.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5: Bloody Razor</h2>

<p>I didn't get very far on this chapter, doing little more than writing descriptions as King Windmaker's war-riders gather, then set out, one two companies off to Withermine, while he takes another two off to Razorpoint Refuge.</p>

<p>Razonpoint Refuge is a fort built at the deepest portion of a crescent-shaped mountain named Razorpoint Ridge.  The interior of Razorpoint Ridge faces into Fortune Fields and is topped with razor-sharp obsidian, while the prevailing wind blows right into it.  The top is high enough that it touches and shaves the bottom off of clouds, causing the land beneath to often fill with fog, incidentally watering the crops for the dwarves living there.</p>

<p>Not only is it fruitful land, but also extremely defensible, so the King's father built a fort there, using the excuse of defending the nearby trade road, to the north, to justify putting a fort so close to troll lands.</p>

<p>King Windmaker splits his force in two, placing them near each tip of the crescent, that they might use a pincer attack when the trolls inevitably come.</p>

<p>Depite the fact backup is on the way, the King worries: Razorpoint Refuge is an impenetrable fortress, impossible to take by force, and yet, the trolls openly declared it as one of their first targets in the war, as if it were a place of weakness.  He can't help but wonder what they know that he doesn't.</p>

<p>The answer will become clear on Monday, when I resume writing, but I'm leaning toward it being a matter of troll women and their magic.  On the other hand, the trolls have no idea the dwarven war-riders even exist, so it should be a really fun opening battle for the war, with unexpected outcomes on both sides.  However, unless I change the chapter title, the battle is going to be bloody.</p>
