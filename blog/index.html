<ul>
<li><a href="work-in-progress-18-starwitch-1.html">Starwitch #1</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 3: Steam Without Flame</h2>

<p>Most of this chapter was descriptive details on Amelia's projects, to slowly demonstrate what she can do, despite her primitive surroundings.</p>

<p>Amelia is 14 in this chapter and now has a small shack to work in.  She pays for things by making and selling high-quality steel ingots to the village smith.</p>

<p>She's working on parts for a steam engine that lacks a firebox, a series of metal plates she's chiseling runes into, including the runes for 'metal', 'boil' and 'water'.</p>

<p>She finishes her work, assembles the plates with some rods to form something reminiscent of a heat sink, though with larger gaps between the plate.  She pours some water on it, which boils off as if the metal was hot, though it's cool to the touch.</p>

<p>I imagine the runes to be the written form of the language of magic, which just about anyone can use, though they need the right knowledge to make use of it: only runes marking metal and stone will work, because metal and stone act as mediums in which magic condenses.</p>

<p>Any previously living material, like wood or paper, will fail, because dead things strive to live again and use up the magic in that attempt.  Effectively, this means dead wood is very slightly zombie (maybe about 0.001%).</p>

<p>Marta (Amelia's oldest sister) joins her, curious to see what she's working on and they have a brief discussion of runes covering the above information.  It's stated that Marta's husband died around the time Amelia was four years old.  She's 12 years older than Amelia.  Marta is a rather large woman and built like a lumberjack, but she's not unattractive.</p>

<p>After they're done talking, Amelia puts the enchanted device inside the little engine's steam chamber and seals it.  She fills it with water and the belt wheel on the side spins, demonstrating that it works. Thus, Amelia is capable of making extremely compact steam engines with a level of power that rivals that of a modern gasoline engine.</p>

<p>Marta asks what's next and Amelia says she needs a carriage.  Marta is confused, because they don't even own a horse, but Amelia insists she needs only the carriage.</p>

<p>In the next scene, months have passed and Amelia has heavily modified a carriage into a horseless carriage and her sisters help her mount a heavy, magic-powered steam engine to the frame.</p>

<p>Amelia's Sister, Iris, is described.  She's a little taller than their mother, who's average height.  She's also exceptionally beautiful.  Her personal history is briefly illuminated as part of her description.</p>

<p>She'd been engaged to the mayor's son, but just days after they announced this to the whole village, he was murdered.  It isn't entirely clear how he died, though he was tied to a tree and wolves got him.  It isn't stated whether the wolves killed him or just ate him.</p>

<p>Iris has been very sad for the past three years, due to losing her betrothed.</p>

<p>With the work done, their mother gives them a picnic basket of food and the three of them head off for a test drive, with Iris in the driver's seat.  She turns out to be a crazy speed-demon and smiles for the first time in years.</p>

<p>Unknown to our main characters, the local smith and his son, both named Rolf Mossflaw (senior and junior, to be clear), were sneaking onto their land while they drove off.  The two of them witness the horseless carriage and Rolf senior concludes that it's witchcraft, despite multiple attempts to justify it as non-magical.</p>

<p>Eventually, the lack of smoke from the steam engine's firebox (it doesn't even have one, but he doesn't know that) forces him to accept the idea it's magic.</p>

<p>The smith and his son head back to the village, to "do the right thing" and tell the mayor, even though they don't want to.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4: A Terrible Choice</h2>

<p>Erika, Amelia's mother, is at home, working to prepare ingredients for potions, since healing potions are how the family made their money before Amelia started making steel.</p>

<p>Her husband, Tim, is a woodcutter, but it's a weekend and he's taken a day off to spend time with his wife, though he's fallen asleep in a rocking chair.</p>

<p>There's a heavy knock on the door, far too loud to be a social visit and Erika concludes the mayor is back to accuse her of being a witch, for the sixteenth time, even though it has been more than a decade since he last accused her.</p>

<p>The mayor once witnessed her using magic while he was drunk and has never let the subject go.</p>

<p>Tim wakes and offers to beat the man, but Erika decides another round of intellectual jousting will be enough to take care of the problem, so he sits down again.  In other words, she decides to handle it herself, since the mayor is an idiot and she normally runs mental circles around him.</p>

<p>She opens the door and Mayor Godfrey Rumblecleaver points the accusatory finger, saying, "She's a witch!  I've seen it with my own eyes!  This woman, Erika Blackwell, has had congress with the devil!  I saw her dance in the forest, naked, alongside a demon!"</p>

<p>He has an entire lynch mob with him, including his deputy.  The mayor is, by ignorant and stupid tradition (according to Erika's internal monologue) also sheriff and judge, though he's bound by law to follow certain procedures.</p>

<p>This involves giving the accused witch a chance to refute his claims.</p>

<p>As an avid reader, Amelia has both read and understood the village's entire law book, having committed it to memory, consequently making the mayor look like a fool once already.  She also taught her mother something: the law book says accusations require two or three witnesses.</p>

<p>Erika points this out, so the mayor provides another witness: the village moonshiner and local drunkard, who claims he saw Erika dance naked with a goat-horned demon!</p>

<p>Erika remembers the only occasion she saw him that week, in which he was drunk off his butt and likely hallucinating, so she isn't surprised he imagined her naked and a passing goat as a demon.</p>

<p>She asks the crowd to raise their hands if they believe the man to be a reliable witness when he's drunk, which is basically whenever he's awake.  No one raises a hand.</p>

<p>Likewise, she refutes the mayor's claim, because everyone knows how drunk he was the night in question, which was when Erika was 15.  She's now 42.</p>

<p>The incident took place during a harvest festival and moonshine had been freely available.  The young man that later became the mayor had been drinking heavily, despite the fact he'd never had any alcohol before.</p>

<p>The smith, Rolf, steps up next, reluctantly telling the tale of seeing Erika's daughters drive a bewitched carriage.  They argue for a time and he presents his irrefutable, expert opinion that it could only have been magically-powered.</p>

<p>Erika demands a second witness and Rolf junior confirms the story.</p>

<p>Seeing he's caught Erika in a situation she can't talk her way out of, the mayor offers a pair of awful alternatives: either Erika's daughters burn as witches, or she does in their place, because the law says a parent can pay for the crimes of a child.</p>

<p>He even goes on to call it a good bargain.  Meanwhile, his face is full of sick glee, because he's finally caught the witch he's chased most of his life.  If Erika agrees, then all she has to do is say out loud that she's a witch.</p>

<p>She says, "I'm a witch" so softly, no one but Tim hears and he rushes to attack the mayor, only to get shot in the shoulder with a crossbow bolt from the deputy.</p>

<p>Erika patches him up and he passes out.</p>

<p>Absolutely reveling in her torment, the mayor says he didn't hear her and she needs to speak up.</p>

<p>Erika speaks louder, but he still isn't satisfied, demanding that she speak loud enough for everyone to hear.</p>

<p>Finally, she shouts her true feelings to the world, including how proud she is to be a witch, making a verbal list of all the good things she's done for the villagers, much of it with secret magic.</p>

<p>She finishes by saying magic isn't evil, but the mayor is, having persecuted her over nothing, for decades.</p>

<p>As her hands are bound by the deputy, she considers torching her accusers with magic, but remembers her grandmother's words on the matter, which were basically, "Do no harm with magic."</p>

<p>She follows the vow of pacifism she made to her grandmother, going quietly to the pile of wood and the stake, to be tied to it, while moonshine is dumped all over the wood to make it burn better.</p>

<p>Before she's lit aflame, the mayor whispers to her, "I had to kill my own son, because one of your whore-of-the-devil daughters bewitched him, just like I did with that poor fool that married Marta!  I'm glad I finally get to see you burn for what you took from me!"</p>

<p>Finally seeing the depth of the man's depravity, Erika speaks her final words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She spoke at a volume comparable to a megaphone, her voice magically enhanced to ensure all ears present would take notice, "Know this day, Mayor Godfrey Rumblecleaver, that your sins will follow you to your very last day, while the gates of the infernal realm gape open and ready to take your soul!</p>

<p>"I declare to all: if any of you ever harms so much as one hair on the heads of my daughters, I <em>will</em> return as a vengeful spirit, with bloody intention to wipe out this entire village, guilty and innocent alike, <em>because evil triumphs when good men do nothing!</em>" Erika gave Rolf and his son a particularly scathing glare, before she looked once more at the now cowering mayor, to speak so softly only he should have heard her final words, though the magic still took them far and wide, "With my last, dying breath, I curse you to never know peace!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of that was just words to mess with everyone's heads, but who knows, maybe the last words of a witch have power beyond mere magic?</p>

<p>Erika uses magic to light the pyre herself, to take control out of his hands of the mob and steal from the mayor the option to believe he killed her.</p>

<p>Shortly after, her daughters arrive, just as a wagon full of men departs.  Marta is driving, barely managing to stop the carriage before succumbing to a numb and helpless silence, while Amelia sputters.</p>

<p>Iris, on the other hand, rushes to the aid of their mother, using magic to part the flame and loosen the ropes, so she can haul Erika free of the blaze, but it's all for naught, because she's already dead.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5: Salt in the Wound</h2>

<p>While Amelia's family are reeling at the loss of their wife/mother, a few days pass and the town crier shows up with a proclamation from the mayor: all property of the confessed witch is to be forfeit to the village and auctioned to pay for the firewood used.</p>

<p>The auction is scheduled for the next day at dawn, though they will have four full days to actually willingly give up the land or make arguments that they should be allowed to keep it.</p>

<p>Amelia's father produces a stack of old wills from her ancestors and she reads them all, discovering that every one of the Blackwell women for the past few centuries has used the same wording in their last will and testament.</p>

<p>The essence of it is that the home and land were given to a specific individual, but everything else became the collective property of their female progeny.</p>

<p>In essence, they foresaw the issue of being discovered as witches and had a strong legal defense in mind to dodge the seizure of property.  They would have done the same with the land and house, but local law forbids joint ownership of real estate, to prevent family arguments from spilling into court.</p>

<p>Amelia attends the auction and makes an attempt to buy their land back, but the mayor out-bids her, paying double the actual value of the land.  Amelia make herself publicly weep by thinking about her mother, but smiles on her way out of the courthouse, because the auction went just the way she planned.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, wagon loads of salt, alchemical waste and lye arrive at the Blackwell family home and their father directs the work of poisoning the land, to make it worthless to the mayor.  At night, the sisters use magic to summon rains storms, so the contamination will sink into the soil.</p>

<p>Their last day on the land, they pack up their belongings and Iris uses fire magic to burn the house's thatch, followed by Marta employing earth magic to make the mortar and stones of the walls crumble.  Last of all, Amelia jams the pressure relief valves of a small steam engine and activates it inside her workshop, before they all run away to avoid the explosion.</p>

<p>Effectively, there's nothing of value left behind.  They stay in a tent that night, but no one can sleep and their father goes out.</p>

<p>He visits the village smith and brow-beats the man into joining him.  They gather others that hate the mayor.</p>

<p>Together, the group throws a blanket over the mayor's head and haul him out of his house for the beating of his life, but before they get going, they tell him why, including among the accusation both everything they know and suspect.  He's warned that if he ever twists the law again, they'll come back to seek vengeance for the three people he's killed (Erika, his own son Conrad, and Marta's husband, Zayne).</p>

<p>In the morning, the mayor fails to show up for the deed to the Blackwell family's land and the subject of where their father went in the night is raised.  He admits nothing, but promises the man is still alive, followed by this little gem: "On those cold, winter nights, I imagine his knee will really ache and I hope he'll be reminded of all the bad things he’s done."</p>

<p>The sisters decide they can live with that and, in fact, it makes them feel slightly better.</p>

<p>They leave the deed to the land under a rock and depart for what they hope will be a land without persecution and prejudice.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6: The Stuff of Dreams</h2>

<p>After two years of off-and-on travel, Amelia and her family are near the city of Macclesfield, a prosperous farming community, where they've been camping long-term, to rest from their travels.</p>

<p>Amelia has built herself a horseless portable workshop in a wagon/shack similar to the one Mr. Pinewater lived in.  Inside, she's built herself a lathe that she's been using to make table legs, because no one in the city has ever seen the results of a lathe before.</p>

<p>Her table legs are all the rage in town with wealthy ladies, even though Amelia thinks the existing legs are better, but she's not going to argue with wealthy people giving her their money to do a job.</p>

<p>Amelia is depressed, because she wants a more permanent home and a much larger workshop, but most towns won't let them buy real estate, because they're outsiders.  Even worse, in the few towns that did, rumor reached all the way from the prejudice-filled village they left behind, causing them to flee for their lives, lest the Blackwell sisters be burned at the stake.</p>

<p>As she works on an order, Amelia reflects that she has wealth, but what she may actually need is influence, to change a few minds, that she might buy land, since she believes she's now beyond the reach of the rumors; it's been eight months since she last heard rumors about her family.</p>

<p>She finishes work and heads for town.</p>

<p>While she's there, she waives her fees in exchange for the the wives of the three members of the city council speaking to their husbands on her behalf, to make an exception to city law, so she can buy land.</p>

<p>It works and she even becomes friends with the mayor's wife, Mrs. Maccle, who has very forward-thinking views of women and thinks Amelia will be just the thing she needs to shake things up, in a good way.  It's never quite stated that way, but Mrs. Maccle is a feminist.</p>

<p>In the next scene, Amelia is shown a huge, disused warehouse, one option among many properties she might buy and she's soon seeing all the possibilities the place holds for her.  It even has an office area that could easily be converted into a comfortable home for her family, solving both issues.</p>

<p>She's soon lost in imaginary visions of what could be, eventually seeing in her mind not just the flying machines she been wanting to experiment with, but airships and eventually, a steel tower rising through the air on a column of super-heated steam!</p>

<p>The tower pierces the heavens and then turns at the apogee of it's flight, producing another burst of steam that carries if forward, until it's falling all the way around the world, always dropping, but never hitting ground, an orbit.</p>

<p>The word 'orbit' sticks in her mind, because she's never heard it before and she realizes the imaginary vision she just had wasn't her own.</p>

<p>She haggles over the price and buys the warehouse, before heading back to her little workshop, where she looks at <em>The Book of Newts</em> and asks, "What are you?"</p>

<p>The book flips of its own accord to the last page, which is blank.  Next, it flips to a page showing a diagram of the solar system.  Finally, it shows her star charts, and she finally realizes the sun the gas giant her little moon orbits is one star among many thousands of named stars, which are mapped in meticulous detail in the book.</p>

<p>She doesn't understand what it's telling her, but she feels exhausted, because the book has been manipulating the magic her body produces to flip it's pages, a feat that has left her with a headache, because her magic is rather weak.  It isn't able to finish what it was telling her, because she doesn't have the magic required for it to finish.</p>

<p>She recognizes the book has some kind of dream or desire, which mostly lines up with her own dreams, though it clearly thinks on a larger scale than she does.  She questions whether she should trust the book, since that was so very strange. It has never harmed her, so she decides to continue on her current path.</p>

<p>She also reasons that perhaps she owes it something for the knowledge shared, deciding to try and fulfill the book's dream of flying to the stars.</p>

<p>At this point, I finally named the gas giant Amelia's moon orbits: Junas.  Amelia believes it's the home of her world's gods, a much bigger world for giant, divine people.  By the way, it looks a lot like Jupiter, but let me make it clear: it isn't.  Junas is orbited by many worlds the size of Earth, plus lots of little ice moons.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7: Wings</h2>

<p>Amelia and her sisters work to haul her first full-size flying machine out of Macclesfield, while townsfolk look on, in wonder.</p>

<p><em>Blackbird</em>, as Amelia named it, is a fixed-wing aircraft with a single propellor, using another of her enchanted steam engines.  Amelia jokingly refers to the cockpit as a 'the witchpit', which is where the term was originally coined.  The aircraft is black and Amelia compares it to a raven.</p>

<p>It's winter and the ground is covered in snow, because Amelia hasn't yet learned about vulcanized rubber and didn't want to deal with metal or wood wheels at such high velocity, thinking the ride would be dangerously bumpy.</p>

<p>Marta drives the plane out into a farm field using another of Amelia's recent inventions, a steam-powered vehicle designed for heavy hauling, a tractor.</p>

<p>When they're ready, Amelia and Iris act as pilot and co-pilot, taking <em>Blackbird</em> into the air!  It's an exhilarating moment as they lift off the ground and Amelia cautiously gets them some altitude in a slow circle around the city, before turning control over to Iris, who does some crazy dives and sharp turns, until Amelia is sick.</p>

<p>Amelia takes them down for a landing, which is the part she's most nervous about, because she expects to crash the first time.</p>

<p>The landing goes smoothly, right up to the point they hit a boulder hidden by the snow!  Since everything is white, Amelia never saw it.</p>

<p>The prop smashes on it, then the engine hits it, producing a spray of hot water and steam, followed by the belly of <em>Blackbird</em> getting torn to shreds on it, while one of the skis is torn right off.  They're briefly forced back into the air, because the boulder somewhat acts like a ramp.</p>

<p>When they come back down, the left wing dips into the snow, due to the missing ski, lurching them to the side, until the wing rips off.  Next, the right wing does much the same, a whiplash-inducing sudden shift from twisting one direction to the other!</p>

<p>The wing also tears off, then the other ski breaks, leaving snow, ice and dirt spraying all over them through the torn bottom of the witchpit.</p>

<p>Amelia pukes, while Iris laughs hysterically and sobs at the same time.</p>

<p>Marta drives up to check on them, but fortunately, the only injuries they've got are lots of bruises and Amelia is motion sick.</p>

<p>There's some discussion of what went wrong and Amelia decides wheels are a must, after all, so she'll be seeking a way to cushion them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Needs must, when evil, dead witches drive…"</p>

<p>&nbsp; – Excerpt from Starwitch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="../books/starwitch/index.html">Starwitch</a> is a novel about space-faring witches that I plan to release first as a web series, then for sale in online stores.</p>

<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@OwenTyme/113483873966306253">You can read short summaries of each day's writing on Mastodon.</a></p>

<h2>About Starwitch</h2>

<p><em>Starwitch</em> is about three sisters that launch themselves into space with magic.  The novel has been named for their ship.  The setting will be primarily fantasy, though with some minor scientific elements, mostly in the form of mathematics, orbital dynamics and steam-powered machines.</p>

<p>I intend to publish this first as an episodic web series, then as a novel, so keep an eye on <a href="../books/starwitch/index.html">the webpage for Starwitch</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: Lonely</h2>

<p>The light sail ship, <em>Starwitch</em>, is sixty meters in length, with a tube-like hull similar to a rocket, though each side has aerodynamic lines that come to a peak and the tail includes control fins for atmospheric flight.</p>

<p>Out of those peaks, as well as the top and bottom, four masts can be extended and various types of spells can be strung between them for any purpose a witch could imagine.  Most often, they'll be used for a light sail that catches light to produce thrust from the solar wind of a star.</p>

<p>The side masts can also be extended and magically enhanced to function as wings during atmospheric flight.</p>

<p>Most of the interior is taken up by water tanks, both for drinking water and use as reaction mass for maneuvering thrusters, though the water can also be used as rocket propellant in combination with magic to heat it, since there's something akin to rocket nozzles at the back.</p>

<p>The entire ship is mechanical in nature, with the most complex non-magical device on board being a clock.  Everything else is based on enchantments or the magic of the witches that fly the ship.</p>

<p><em>Starwitch</em> has to be flown entirely manually, with a set of winches inside the 'witchpit' (cockpit) used to control the angle of the four masts.</p>

<p>As the story begins, the youngest of the sisters, Amelia, is alone and she's had only two hours sleep in three days.  She's hot on the heels of a far larger ship owned by the infamous pirate, the Dead Queen.  The other ship is a massive block of granite floating in space, which Amelia refers to as a monolith, since it's all one piece of rock.</p>

<p><em>Starwitch</em> was attacked by the monolith and the Dead Queen stole the enchanted mythril spell-core of <em>Starwitch</em> that allows even a weak witch like Amelia to perform high-intensity magic.  The Queen also kidnapped Amelia's sisters, to consume their magic and their souls, that she might extend her undead existence.</p>

<p>Amelia was intentionally left for dead, with just enough resources to follow the monolith, but not enough to reach safety, a sort of sport the Dead Queen has engaged in for centuries, just to see what a desperate and weak witch might do.</p>

<p>Amelia watches the monolith entering orbit of an icy moon, presumably to take on water for propellant, and she takes a somewhat different path, heading for a polar orbit.</p>

<p>She intends to meet the monolith on the other side of the moon, where she'll attack.</p>

<p>As she awaits her moment, which is days away, Amelia looks back on her memories with regret.  It all started so innocently, with a book...</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: The Book of Newts</h2>

<p>Amelia is ten years old and practically vibrates with excitement.  She's read every book available in the house and her mother has promised her that when Mr. Pinewater next visits, she'll get a book of her very own.</p>

<p>The old man comes to visit her family and in exchange for a healing potion from Amelia's mother, Mr. Pinewater allows Amelia to select a book from the collection he keeps in his wagon, which is basically a shack on wheels.</p>

<p>While the old guy digs for books on magic to entice her with, Amelia is asked to temporarily hold an old tome titled <em>The Book of Newts</em>.  Initially, it appears to be a book all about the water-dwelling amphibians, but for one brief instant, it shows its true nature to her.  The title is actually 'Newton's Mechanics'.  She blinks and it goes back to being <em>The Book of Newts</em>.</p>

<p>The old guy tries to get her to look at the books on magic, but Amelia decides she'd rather have a magical book, than a book about magic.  In fact, she insists, despite his every attempt to guide her to one of his books on magic, mimicking a very witchy tone of command her mother uses (Amelia's mother is also a witch).</p>

<p>She leaves the wagon/shack and the old guy drops his illusion.  He's still old, but no longer disheveled and his clothes become the fine, black robes of a wizard, while his hat turns pointy and black.</p>

<p>For a time, he worries he's done the wrong thing, because the book will raise Amelia to the stars, where a dangerous enemy lurks, but having seen the girl's insatiable thirst for knowledge, he decides it would be far more cruel to stifle the girl's potential, because he considers her a prodigy.  After all, she's already smarter than he is.</p>

<p>He's confident the child will succeed where he failed, though he's uncomfortable about the path he's set her on.</p>

<h2>Chapter 42: Pale Imitations</h2>

<p>This chapter opens with Lara entering the mine Wrath is using as his base on Earth.  She uses Mashu'ra's nose to smell out the situation, realizing all seven arch-demons are inside.</p>

<p>She asks, "You ready to go down in a blaze of glory, Masher?  I don’t think we’ll survive the day, but I’m game if you are."</p>

<p>Mashu'ra's response is straight to the point: "They took the boss.  She’s always been a key part of Vogerath’s plan to open a portal to Hell, because he can’t stabilize it without a half-demon.  So, this is bigger than us.  I’d sacrifice myself to save the world, any day of the week, because that’s what the boss would do."</p>

<p>With that confirmation of commitment, Lara heads deeper into the mine.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Insanity is happy to be free of the Hunter's head, with a physical body of her own.  She feels a little short on energy, but looks around at the seven arches, seeing the equivalent of a buffet.</p>

<p>As he backs away, Insanity screams, "I’m The Eighth Deadly Sin, Willful Insanity!  All of you demons are pale imitations of me, because people would have to be crazy to sin!  You have one chance to survive: bow down to me and pledge your eternal servitude or I’ll eat you all!"</p>

<p>Wrath is about to put the cursed wedding band made by Lust on Insanity's finger, but she points out the fact she's not in a binding circle.  Wrath looses his cool and real terror crosses his face!</p>

<p>One of the three bodies Pride showed up in changes form to a little garden snake and sneaks off, while Lust and Greed make their way toward the exit.  The other arches stand together, as a unified front, because they've all been challenged, though Sloth yawns.</p>

<p>Insanity considers Sogliun, the moon demon, to be the only real threat in the room, but he chickens out and flows downward, into the floor, while no one is looking.</p>

<p>Pride speaks for all: "We won’t serve you, but might be persuaded to allow you to join our ranks.  Though a few examples of the eighth arch demon have existed in the past, each was a dangerous, rogue element, definitely not a team player.  Will you be the same, or will you join us?"</p>

<p>Insanity's answer is to head-butt Wrath, while she impales both of Pride's bodies on her claws.  Wrath is hit so hard, his head goes rolling away.  Insanity eats both of Pride's bodies, somewhat refilling her energy reserves.</p>

<p>Still conscious, Wrath's head rolls to a stop near the third copy of Pride.</p>

<p>Wrath asks for help and Pride eats him, which was according to Pride's plan, all along, because he intends to eat all of the arches and then eat their boss, the Void.</p>

<p>Alice looks on as Insanity deals with the arches, bothered by the fact that the Hunter seems to be dying.  After some magical analysis, she realizes the Hunter is missing human genetics that she requires to survive on her own and with the demon separated from her mind and body, she can't gather the magic she'd been using to sustain herself.</p>

<p>Alice clasps the Hunter's forearm and begins feeding her magic, though it's only a stop-gap measure, that will buy half an hour.</p>

<p>Envy tries to escape, but Insanity crushes her to death with the thrown corpse of Wrath.</p>

<p>Gluttony is scared, rightly afraid she's about to be eaten, while her bodyguards abandon her, aside from one.</p>

<p>Her last bodyguard turns out to be a regular fairy that's been bound to serve Gluttony by some bargain the two of them made.  He takes the form of a humanoid turtle made of diamond.  Gluttony is smashed with the body of her last bodyguard, thrown like a projectile.  I just wanted to do a little foreshadowing for a later book.</p>

<p>Insanity turns her attention on Lust and Greed.  There's a brief argument and Insanity decides to slay Lust, but can't, stopping a fraction of an inch from the kill.  She tries again, but same results.</p>

<p>Lust reiterates the bargain she made with the Hunter in the previous book: She must protect Lust and Lust will answer any question the Hunter asks.  Insanity was part of the Hunter at the time, so she's bound by the agreement.</p>

<p>Insanity screams in her face, "There’s nothing I want to ask!"</p>

<p>Insanity kills Greed and his guards, then grabs Lust.  She warns the arch-demon that she'll keep her 'safe' and 'alive', but that Lust may not like her definition of those words, if she presses her luck.</p>

<p>Turning to Sloth, Insanity asks, "What about you, Sticky?"  I like this little nickname, because Sloth is a living goo monster.</p>

<p>Sloth just wants to go home, without a fight.</p>

<p>Insanity punches him, splattering him all over the walls.</p>

<p>She thinks he's dead and turns away, but he speaks again, "It isn’t that easy."</p>

<p>Sloth tries sleep magic, because he's famed for it, and everyone present falls asleep, except himself and Insanity, because "Madness never sleeps."</p>

<p>She tries to swallow Sloth whole, but Sloth explodes into mist.  She thinks it's a self-destruct spell designed to prevent him from being eaten, but Sloth was never truly there.  He only showed up by dream-walking, more or less a variation of astral projection.</p>

<p>Insanity looks on Alice and the Hunter and decides to eat them, since with the Hunter out of her head, she no longer has any sense of fair play.</p>

<p>Alice wakes in time to see the gaping maw of Insanity and has just enough time to manifest the torn mushroom cap that allows her to grow larger, cramming the whole thing in her mouth!</p>

<p>At the same time, Lara arrives, just in time to see, but not understand the resulting explosion, as Alice grows so fast, she smashes her way through the roof of the cave!</p>

<h2>Chapter 43: Remorse of Conscience</h2>

<p>Alice's transformation leaves her standing in a hole in the ceiling, as the light of dawn filters through her dress, bathing the room in blue light.  Each of her feet (in boots, of course) is six feet long!</p>

<p>During the collapse cause by Alice's actions, Insanity rushed to the side of Lust, to deflect falling boulders.</p>

<p>Alice bellows, "How dare you try to kill our sister?"</p>

<p>Alice steps back (the ground shakes as she walks) and peers down into the hole.  She reaches to pick up the Hunter, to keep her safe, but Insanity screams, "She's mine!"</p>

<p>Insanity attack's Alice's hand with her claws and Alice tries to punch her, much the way a human might try to smash a mouse!  Insanity flops on her back and accepts the strick, so she can use all four sets of claws, latching onto Alice's hand!</p>

<p>Alice hauls her hand back out of the hole, taking Insanity away, though she stumbles off, causing another quake.</p>

<p>Lara drops her invisibility spell and rushes to the Hunter's side, asking what happened.</p>

<p>Lust actually takes responsibility, actually in tears over the guilt she feels.  She even apologizes.</p>

<p>Lust explains everything, including why she did it (revenge), but now she feels awful about it.</p>

<p>Lara turns her into a Tommy gun and points it right in Lust's face, to demand, "Give me one good reason I shouldn't kill you right here and now!"</p>

<p>Lust explains what needs to happen to reintegrate the Hunter: her three personalities need to willingly merge.  Alternatively, the giant can eat Insanity, then merge.</p>

<p>Lust begins to feel remorse for every single wrong thing she's ever done, which isn't a short list, with sins darker and more bloody than the worst serial killer, because her conscience is finally working properly, as a result of her recent religious reading habits.</p>

<p>Lara decides to let Lust live, but only of she signs an unconditional contract to answer Lara's questions.  Lara hands over a sheet of paper and Lust writes, 'I promise to answer the questions of Lara Simmons.'  She bites her thumb and stamps the page with her bloody fingerprint, sealing the bargain.</p>

<p>The Hunter calls attention to herself, because she's a hair away from death, so Lara uses a little magic to transfer Mashu'ra into the girl's body.  Mashu'ra gets her back on her feet and in fighting form, at the cost of great pain, but the Hunter reasons a little pain is a small price to pay to save the world.</p>

<p>After all, with Insanity running loose, every human in the world is in danger.</p>

<p>Lara returns her hat and asks, "You ready to rock and roll?"</p>

<p>The Hunter nods, so Lara turns into an M1911 pistol, which the Hunter catches out of the air.</p>

<p>She steps over to Lust and points it right in her face.  For a tense moment, Lust believes she's about to die, based on the idea of the Hunter pointing the gun as a mere threat, while the imp (Mashu'ra) pulls the trigger.  She closes her eyes and accepts her fate.</p>

<p>The Hunter fires, putting a bullet through Lust's ear, because she's beyond pissed.  Lust opens her eyes just in time to be pistol-whipped!</p>

<p>Lara orders her to stay put and threatens a fate worse than death if she isn't there when they come back, claiming she just put a tracking curse on Lust, with that bullet.</p>

<p>The Hunter screams in Lust's face, then flies out of the hole in the ceiling.</p>

<h2>Chapter 44: Rock and Roll</h2>

<p>Alice struggles with Insanity, discovering her giant size has some serious disadvantages: it slows her regenerative powers and makes her a big target, despite giving her incredible strength.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Insanity winds her way up and around Alice's arm, cutting her all the way to the bone!  Alice tries to scrape her off, but Insanity dodges.</p>

<p>Getting desperate, Alice calls DRINK ME into her hand and downs the entire bottle!  She explosively shrinks down to the size of an ant and brags hold of Insanity's fur, with the intent of reaching the ear, where such a tiny figure might do some serious damage.</p>

<p>The Hunter flies into the air, seeing Insanity fall as Alice vanishes.</p>

<p>Lara turns into a Barret M107 anti-material rifle and the Hunter puts a round through Insanity's head, causing it to explode!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Alice has reached the spot between Insanity's shoulder blades, where she decided to take a short breather.  She's really grateful she took the breather, because otherwise, she might have been hit.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Insanity is beyond the power of the average demon and manages to regenerate her head, a feat no other demon can match!</p>

<p>Alice continues her climb.</p>

<p>Knowing the situation is too hot for Lara, who might easily be killed in the mayhem, the Hunter leaves her behind and charges into battle.</p>

<p>Lara is upset by this, but decides to find a hiding place, so she can still contribute, by sniping.</p>

<p>The Hunter and Insanity roll through the Outback like a pair of angry, giant cats, but while the hunter gets stronger the more damage she takes, she also gets more stupid, the same issue Simmons always dealt with in cat-man form!</p>

<p>She lets go and kicks Insanity away, so she can think.  She concludes brute strength is not the answer and none of her armored forms would work, either.</p>

<p>She wants to try grenades, but realizes she can't reach any of her gear inside her hat, without her demon powers.</p>

<p>She's also somewhat worried her mother's magic isn't protecting her, but her mother's power was split three ways and she's become ineffectual as a result.</p>

<p>She has Wood, Water, Air and Fire magic, so she combines the first three to rapidly grow trees to snare Insanity in a web of wood.  Insanity is so strong, however, that she immediately starts to break free, so the Hunter adds some Fire magic, using the wood for fuel, while she produces pure oxygen with Air magic!  The flame gets so hot, it burns blue!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Alice is in Insanity's ear and worries she's about to be burned to death.  She magically produces the mushroom cap and eats the whole thing in one bite!</p>

<p>Alice violently explodes out of Insanity's head, then starts punching the demon with her full, gigantic strength!</p>

<p>Insanity produces a painful telepathic scream of rage that sends Alice stumbling away, before she falls to the ground, causing an earthquake!  Likewise, the Hunter is stunned, while Insanity gets back to her feet!</p>

<p>Lara opens fire, once again exploding the demon's head!</p>

<p>We switch to the perspective of Lust, who's guilt in this matter stirs her to action, because she can sense our heroes are losing the fight.</p>

<p>She feels she must help, so she flies out to join them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lara empties her magazine, repeatedly blowing Insanity's head off, though she grows back faster each time.  On the other hand, Lara has always laced her rounds with either poison or disease and Insanity does slow down a bit.</p>

<p>Once Lara's all out of ammunition (it takes her a while to magically produce .50-cal rounds, since they're so large), Insanity picks up the Hunter, in preparation to eat her, once and for all.</p>

<p>Lust arrives and pours on every bit of charm magic she can, slowing Insanity down with multiple tempting offers that match Lust's nature.  Her words make Alice and the Hunter both blush.</p>

<p>While Insanity is distracted, the Metal Spirit, which killed Simmons, shows up and whispers to the Hunter.  As usual, it does so in poetic rhymes of four lines.</p>

<p>It uses flowery words to apologize for killing Simmons, then explains its nature as having been forged from earth using fire, air and water, hinting that it's a child of all four of the basic elements.  The rhyme also implies that humanity made it what it is.  I like this as an explanation for why it's so strong, probably the most powerful elemental spirit, aside from Life and the Void.</p>

<p>Therefore, it decides to serve the Hunter willingly, that she might save humanity.</p>

<p>There's a brief scene inside the Hunter's head, in which it bows to her, offers up a token (a cast-iron and steel bracelet) and the Hunter collars it, much like she did with the Water and Air spirits in previous books.</p>

<p>Coming back to the real world, Insanity once more picks up the Hunter, then opens her mouth extra wide, to eat her.  The Hunter hears Vogerath/Pride screaming, amused by the sound.</p>

<p>The chapter comes to a close as the Hunter focuses her mind to use Metal magic for the first time, while the bracelet tinkles on her wrist, since those tokens are both metaphors and real objects.</p>

<h2>Chapter 45: (Re)forging Bonds</h2>

<p>Insanity snaps her jaws shut on the Hunter, only to break some of her teeth!  Letting go and stepping back, she sees the Hunter's clothes have produced metal plates, just like a suit of armor!</p>

<p>This metal-shrouded transformation is much like the iron wood armor she got from subjugating the Jungle Spirit, but instead of some rather heavy wood, the metal spirit has given her armor plates composed of layered titanium and tungsten, producing something with properties of both.</p>

<p>Insanity throws a temper tantrum, slamming her fists into the ground, producing brief earthquakes!</p>

<p>In the background, Alice drinks her potion, returning to normal size, mostly so she can heal.</p>

<p>The Hunter looks Insanity in the eye and raises a hand, then pretends with the other she's turning a crack attached to the first, seemingly resulting in her middle finger popping up.</p>

<p>Insanity is actually amused, saying, "I like that gesture.  It fits the Robocop thing you've got going."</p>

<p>But having seen her greatest desire frustrated, Insanity is done with the fight and decides to walk away, though she promises to return to eat the Hunter, followed by every one of her sheep (meaning the human race).  She plans to force the Hunter to watch as she wipes out everyone.</p>

<p>The Hunter screams at her, but Insanity ignores her.</p>

<p>Working with Mashu'ra, the Hunter produces a wall of fire to block Insanity's way, which curves around all three of them, in a huge circle.</p>

<p>Insanity turns back to point out the futility of continuing to fight, while the symbols required to bind a demon begin appearing in the flames, thanks to Mashu'ra, while seven more fiery binding circles forming.</p>

<p>When the first circle closes, Mashu'ra is significantly weakened, but the Hunter picks up the slack and maintains the magic long enough for Mashu'ra to finish shaping all the binding symbols.  He falls unconscious and ends up on her shoulder.</p>

<p>Having lost Mashu'ra's power, the Hunter collapses, but gives the demon double middle fingers, before she falls over.</p>

<p>Insanity screams and charges, but runs out of power before she reaches the Hunter, because her demonic powers have been sealed.  She scrabbles to get closer, but lacks the strength to move and throws another temper-tantrum, demonstrating how immature she is, without the Hunter.</p>

<p>She's horribly upset and complaining about how 'unfair' the situation is.</p>

<p>Aliget gets up, bites into her mushroom cap and grows back to giant size.  She picks up the helpless demon and eats her, though she does say something soothing, to try and make Insanity feel slightly better about it.</p>

<p>Alice takes a swig of DRINK ME and returns to normal size.  She lays down next to the Hunter and asks, "Can we be friends?"</p>

<p>As far as the Hunter is concerned, they already are, and even better, they're sisters, so she nods agreement.</p>

<p>Alice vanishes, re-absorbed by the Hunter.</p>

<p>The Hunter puts Mashu'ra in her hat.</p>

<p>The hunter enters her mindscape, finding Alice has made a little corner of it her own, with a small patch of gigantic grass, a tiny little sun for some light and a huge mushroom, on which Alice sits.  Beside that are a record player producing psychedelic rock and a little apple tree with grenades instead of apples.</p>

<p>Alice is smoking form the Caterpillar's hookah, while the Caterpillar has been put in a specialized straight-jacket designed to keep it's very many arms under control.  It's mouth is gagged, but it soon gets that loose and growls in the voice of Insanity.</p>

<p>“Quit harshing my buzz and relax for once!” Alice complains and shoves the stem of the hookah in the demon’s mouth.</p>

<p>Insanity inhales, but doesn't like it, spitting it out, before another torrent of complaints come form the Caterpillar's mouth.</p>

<p>The response of Alice is to slap Insanity, followed by telling her to shut up.</p>

<p>The Hunter falls over laughing, because this is something hilarious she never expected to see!</p>

<p>Lara finds the Hunter rolling in the dirt, laughing until she cries.  Concerned, she calls the Hunter by name, calling her Artemis.</p>

<p>She stops laughing and considers that name, which was given by Simmons.  She still sad she's lost him, but she's ready to accept that name as part of moving forward.  From this point on, she starts referring to herself as Artemis.</p>

<p>Lara helps her up and together, they seek out Lust, finding her stuck in the dirt, unable to free herself, because she hit the ground that hard, when Insanity backhanded her.</p>

<p>They help her out and Lara thinks her for helping. Lust doesn't accept her gratitude, because she doesn't feel she deserves it and apologizes to Artemis for everything she's done wrong.</p>

<p>Lara asks Artemis if she can handle transportation and she puts Lust in her hat.  Lara turns into a pistol, for ease of carrying, and Artemis vanishes into a puff of smoke.</p>

<h2>Chapter 46: Hemming the Fray</h2>

<p>Artemis reappears far above <em>The Cauldron of the Elements</em> (Macie's home valley).</p>

<p>She enjoys the view as she falls, in Australia, dawn was just over, but here, dusk is about to begin.</p>

<p>And yes, that does finally pin down the timezone of the place, likely putting it somewhere in the Appalachian mountain range, but I'm not going any further than that.  It's a fictional place, so don't go looking for it.  And now that I've started a conspiracy theory, let's get back to the story.</p>

<p>From above, it looks desolate and dead, because the interior is masked by an illusion spell, to keep it safe.  Artemis passes through this, revealing the forest and blue lake.</p>

<p>She takes control of her fall and flies down to Macie's house, where she knocks on the door, then flies out of sight three times, messing with Macie's head as she answers.</p>

<p>Lara ends the game by speaking and Macie invites them in.</p>

<p>Hours later, James and Lara have fallen asleep on the couch, leaving a lovely scene of mother and son.</p>

<p>Artemis and Macie sneak out quietly, to avoid waking them, and head for the old amphitheater and stage.  There, Macie begins teaching Artemis to dance and juggle, which are both important components of <em>The Dance of Fire and Autumn</em>.</p>

<p>Decades earlier, when Artemis met the Fire Spirit, it promised to willingly serve her, if she could subjugate the Metal Spirit, then summon the Fire Spirit via the dance.  Having gotten the Metal Spirit under control, thanks to Simmons, she now wishes to summon the Fire Spirit, because she's convinced it will be useful in combat.</p>

<p>Artemis has trouble with dancing, tripping over her own feet, but picks up juggling fairly quickly.</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>Lust is back in a cell, reflecting on how much she's changed and how far she has to go.  Lara and Verda just finished an interrogation session, which Lust fully cooperated with.</p>

<p>Cooperation has led to improvements in Lust's living arrangements, including a soft bed and a chair for her to relax in, as well as more choice in food selection, but Lust doesn't think she deserves any of it.</p>

<p>Each such session leaves her wanting to die, because she's wracked with guilt for her many, many dark deeds, but she staves off such thoughts by reading The Book of Mormon.</p>

<p>After reading for a time, she prays.  She isn't certain if God is real or not, but knows that praying certainly makes her feel better.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure where I'm going with Lust's journey, but I'm planning to span it over the course of several more novels.  However, part of it is clear: Lust's journey to redemption demonstrates the fact that the "demons" aren't actually what they claim to be, further emphasizing the fact they're dark fairies, because they can change.</p>

<p>Switching to Artemis, we find her putting James in his crib after a meal and some cartoons, because he fell asleep on the couch and she's been babysitting for Lara.</p>

<p>Lara and Verda enter the apartment.  Lara starts a meal, while Verda sits on the couch and Artemis sit opposite her, in a chair.  They acknowledge each other, before Verda falls asleep on the couch.</p>

<p>After all, with both Lara and Artemis in the place, who have both defeated Wrath, Verda feels totally safe and can sleep peacefully.  It isn't a permanent solution to her post-traumatic stress, but quality rest is required for proper mental healing.</p>

<p>Artemis reflects on the fact they had been grieving the loss of Simmons separately, but ironically, Wrath somehow managed to bring them together.</p>

<p>She also reflects on the valuable lesson Evie and Simmons taught her: Artemis will always value the time she has with her friends, short though it may be.  However, she will never stop fighting to keep them safe.</p>

<h2>The Editing Process</h2>

<p>With the Epilogue finished, I've completed the rough draft of <a href="../books.html#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>.</p>

<p>This work-in-progress log will pause until I begin a new project, so I can do a pass of editing on <em>She Seeks Peace</em>.  With the way I've been using text to speech software for my daily editing, I've been finding my typos and spelling mistakes earlier on, so I'm likely to only do one editing pass, mostly a matter of looking at the plot.  I'll do more when it comes time to publish, but I'm eager to get to my next project.</p>

<p>I'm likely to add some scenes in which the Metal Spirit comes to Artemis/the Hunter, looking to apologize, because its appearance at the end was a bit abrupt.  That will give me the opportunity to add a couple of funny places our heroine can seek peace.</p>

<p>One of the scenes I had in mind, but never used, was to have her hide among a herd of black and white cows.  Her magic clothes will give her camouflage, to fit in with them.  My thinking is there will be lots of metal fencing near the cows, justifying the presence of the Metal Spirit.</p>

<p>I think I need to come up with two more little scenes like that, just to subtly introduce the idea of it's presence for the final fight, though I need to be careful about when and where I insert them.  I think they would work best early on in the novel.</p>

<p>I mentally justify its presence in Australia with the fact the final battle took place near an old, abandoned mine (it wasn't quite as played-out as the owner thought), on top of the fact Australia exports a lot of mined metals.  Perhaps I need to throw another four line block into its rhymes, to serve as a sort of explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Metal, Metal everywhere,<br/>
Under feet, here and there.<br/>
Metal made from Metal ore,<br/>
Man ever digs, such a chore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would also fit with previous appearances, because it usually makes reference to metal Artemis didn't realize was present.</p>

<p>Other than that, the only other thing I'll need to do is add some descriptive details, which I always do during editing.</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>

<p>There's two possibilities looming for my next project, the first a short story, the other a novel.</p>

<h3>The Recruit (Working Title)</h3>

<p><em>The Recruit</em> will be a short story centering around Detective Shime Yasu, who readers may recall from <a href="../books/ashen-blades/demon-for-president.html">Demon for President!</a></p>

<p>You might remember that she was given a special card to use, which had a number for her to call when she's "ready to open her eyes".  The story will begin with Yasuy lying awake, unable to sleep, because her mind is too busy with the bizarre things she saw in the body cam videos of Ulmoch and Artemis in action.</p>

<p>She'll call the number and the story will show a glimpse into the recruiting and training process for the Order of Ash and Smoke.  Artemis, Lara and Verda will work together for training.</p>

<p>Yasu will be one among many local recruits, but the story will center around disabusing the group of all misconceptions about demons, because all of them brought weapons they thought would be effective, including crosses, holy water and some dumb fool got confused, so he brought a wooden stake.</p>

<p>It will be a simple story, in which Artemis captures a demon for training purposes, while Lara tests all of the things the recruits brought, once more hammering home the point that they're not actually demons, because the crosses do nothing, the holy water just gets him wet and hammering the stake into his heart just gets him to make creepy comments (Ulmoch has always been a masochist, so he enjoys people hurting him).</p>

<p>Finally, Yasu will ask, "So, what does work?"</p>

<p>Lara will transform into an M1911 and Artemis will shoot Ulmoch in the head, while Lara delivers the punchline: ".45 rounds are good."</p>

<p>Yep, the whole story is just setup for a joke, though I think ending it with Yasu sleeping soundly would be a nice touch.</p>

<p>I've had this story in mind since I wrote the bits involving Detective Yasu, but had to get past <em>She Seeks Peace</em> to know the mental state of my characters, since the ending of <a href="../books/ashen-blades/demon-for-president.html">Demon for President!</a> was a big, dangling plot thread.</p>

<h3>Star Witch</h3>

<p>The other project I'm eager to get to is tentatively titled <em>Star Witch</em>.  This will be about a trio of witches and sisters that used magic to launch themselves into space.</p>

<p>The story will focus on one of the sisters, who's named Amelia.  She's the enchanter and engineer that built the light-sail ship, named <em>Star Witch</em>, but lacks talent for other forms of magic, barely able to operate the ship on her own power.</p>

<p>Most of the details are foggy to me, but I know it begins with Amelia alone aboard <em>Star Witch</em>, aside from the house brownies that serve as the ship's repair crew, though she's never seen them.</p>

<p>Amelia is extremely exhausted at this point, because she's been operating the ship around the clock with minimal breaks for sleep, when it was designed to be operated in shifts or left to its own devices for long periods of time.</p>

<p>Amelia's sisters were kidnapped several days earlier and <em>Star Witch</em> was left badly damaged, all by order of the villain, the Dead Queen.</p>

<p>Amelia has been following the Dead Queen's monolith (a huge, granite slab with tunnels cut through it, which serves as her star ship), using the bigger ship's wake of waste magic to barely keep her own light sails functional.</p>

<p>My plan is to do a series of flashbacks on the lives of the three sisters building and launching <em>Star Witch</em>, followed by docking at a space station, where they'll hear tales of the Dead Queen, a powerful witch that drains the life and magic from other witches, to extend her own life.</p>

<p>Eventually, the story will culminate in the monolith moving into parking orbit above an icy moon in the present (they've stopped to take on water, which is required for various processes aboard the big ship, despite the crew being undead), while Amelia goes around the moon the other way.</p>

<p>Amelia's intent is to surprise the monolith from the front, rather than attacking from behind, the last thing the Dead Queen might expect.  Amelia has no other choice: she's dead without either the stolen mythril core of her ship or the backup of her sisters; she's the weakest of the three witches, barely able to get <em>Star Witch</em> moving on her own.</p>

<p>The truth is, the Dead Queen setup the entire situation for the sake of entertainment, a sort of sport she's played with smaller ships for centuries.  She takes the strongest witches to extend her life and leaves the very weakest with a barely functional vessel, eager to learn what a desperate witch might do.</p>

<p>However, she didn't know and didn't count on <em>Star Witch</em> being full of house brownies, which can repair the ship, even in the absence of proper supplies, nor did she count on Amelia's exceptional skill with mathematics and engineering, which will be the lesser witch's greatest weapons.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure how Amelia will get her sisters back, but I do know she'll intentionally crash <em>Star Witch</em> into the monolith, so she can board the pirate vessel.  This might involve crashing into a docking bay, but thinking about it, the bridge would be far more fun, a combination of destroying command and control functionality, followed by a desperate rescue mission, while the house brownies hold the line against the Dead Queen's soldiers.</p>

<p>I'm going to use Amelia's lonely tale as a framing story for the novel, to add tension and foreshadowing for the climax, coming back to it at the start and close of each part of the novel.</p>

<p><a href="https://books2read.com/DemonForPresident"><img src="../images/Flyer-DemonForPresident.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p>Today, November 5, 2024, is a very special and strange day, at least in the United States, where I live.  The current election and division between the Republicans and Democrats really inspired me to pay attention during the first republican debate, last year.</p>

<p>I've never voted, since politics has always literally given me a splitting headache, because there's too many lies to really uncover the truth.  Cynically, I sometimes wonder if there's any truth to be found, at all.</p>

<p>Still, I wasn't paying attention to the politics, but rather to the behavior of political candidates, because I'd had a bizarre, fun and timely idea for a novel: what would happen if a demon ran for President of the United States?</p>

<p>So, I watched and continually found material that could be twisted into political satire, all the while unsure if I had the skill to make the novel work.  I got it published in June, just in time for the current election to really heat up.</p>

<p>With voting happening today, I've been thinking about that novel, which is titled <a href="../books/ashen-blades/demon-for-president.html">Demon for President!</a></p>

<p>I ran the election and potential twists through my head many times during the writing process, but never did I expect so many parallels between fiction and the real world.</p>

<p>In my novel, the demonic villain, Otto Vogerath, was shot at by a sniper while cutting the ribbon for a store.  On July 13, Former President Trump became the target of a sniper, an event that chilled me to the bone, because reality became eerily like something I'd written.</p>

<p>For another example, I wrote about the President bowing out of the election to make way for another candidate, so it really caught my attention when that happened!</p>

<p>There are other parallels, but none so shocking as those two, or which I would care to discuss, because I'm not here to draw connections between real people and fictional characters that really aren't connected.</p>

<p>I wrote the novel early this year and published it in June, <em>before</em> these events took place, but all I can think is this: art imitates life and life imitates art.  There is truth to that old adage, after all.</p>

<p>I found the experience of writing political satire to be fun, educational and even intellectually stimulating, but at the same time, it made me nervous to see my fiction come true in such unsettling ways.  I can't say I found that part of the experience enjoyable, which may be why I haven't discussed this novel as much as others.</p>

<p>I meant it all in fun, as a way to point out how silly and funny politicians can be, but I think I cut this piece too close to reality.  It surprises me, the things I see without comprehending, which can so easily become a part of my work.</p>

<p>So much of my writing process is a subconscious black box, which I don't even pretend to understand, a gift that must be fed for me to retain it, but which sometimes produces things that leave me speechless for the most unusual reasons.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I can take any more parallels with my novel, but hopefully, our next president won't open a portal to Hell, so endless legions of demons can march forth to conquer the Earth.  That would be one bit of straw too many for this particular camel.</p>

<p>Still, once the dust of this election clears, why not read about what could have been, if we'd gotten a <a href="../books/ashen-blades/demon-for-president.html">Demon for President?</a></p>

<h2>Chapter 38: Letting Go</h2>

<p>Evie spends all morning and afternoon speaking with the spirits of her dead friends.  It gets pretty emotional for her, because she's doing her best to let them go, so they can pass on.</p>

<p>The Hunter holds her hand and Evie squeezes it pretty hard with each tearful goodbye.  She grows a little older with each, until she's about thirty years old.</p>

<p>Last of all, she talks with her grandmother, but Evelyn asks to speak with the Hunter and Evie makes her visible.</p>

<p>Evelyn explains that she watched the world with magic for a very long time, looking for a champion to take Evie to her family.  She'd heard of the Hunter, but couldn't see her, because the hunter is effectively invisible to most forms of detection magic.</p>

<p>In August (around the same time the Hunter went back in time, during the previous book), the Fates appeared to her in a vision, telling her the Hunter was on the way, to take Evie to family.</p>

<p>She asks if the Fates can be trusted and the Hunter somewhat reluctantly agrees, because she at least trusts them to help her against Vogerath.  That reassures Evelyn she did the right thing and she passes on, vanishing from sight.</p>

<p>The Hunter comforts Evie for a time, before the rapidly-aging woman says she's tired and lonely.  The Hunter pats her back and Riley steps in, for a group hug.</p>

<p>He reminds Evie, "You're not alone."</p>

<p>After that, Evie asks to be left alone, for a nap.  She also corrects her accent mid-sentence, finally figuring out how to pronounce the letter L, promising to make Simmons visible, once she's rested.</p>

<p>As Riley and the Hunter leave the bedroom, Riley expresses his worry that Evie might not stop growing older, because she's now in her mid-forties!</p>

<p>There's a brief scene in which Evie is alone with her thoughts and she briefly considers suicide, that she might be with her friends.  The first of the monks that died was a woman with depression issues, who took her own life, though Evie hadn't understood that at the time.  Having seen how that didn't solve anything, she decides against suicide.</p>

<p>She doesn't realize it, but she's growing older by the moment and she's already rapidly headed toward a death by natural causes, though her aging slows as she falls asleep.</p>

<p>Some time later, Evie calls out for help.  Riley and the Hunter rush in, finding Evie on the floor: she fell out of bed and can't get up, because she's now over ninety years old!</p>

<p>They help her back into bed.  She offers to make Simmons visible and the Hunter prepares by hauling Mashu'ra out of her hat.</p>

<p>Simmons appears and thanks Mashu'ra for giving him the chance to fight demons.  Next, he tells them both he loves them and admits this is going to be goodbye for a long time, though he'll wait until the end of time to see the Hunter again, if required.</p>

<p>He also discusses the fact that he knows neither of them will let go of life until the demon threat is permanently solved.</p>

<p>Finally, he addresses the elephant in the room, asking the Hunter to let him go, because she's been dragging him through life like a boat anchor.  He isn't angry, because she had no idea her magic had responded to her emotions by binding his spirit to her, but he <em>is</em> upset that he can't pass on.</p>

<p>Last of all he says: "Go ahead and treasure the time we had together, but don’t hold onto me so tight."</p>

<p>The Hunter enters her internal mindscape, like the way she fought Sogliun, seeking the deepest, darkest corner of her mind, where she buries things she doesn't want to deal with.</p>

<p>This turns out to be a steel-lined corridor, along which hangs paintings, each of which is a different traumatic memory.  Two examples are the death of her parents and Reggie's death.  She takes the painting of Reggie's final moments off the wall and puts it under her arm as she goes deeper, seeking the darkest corner of the place.</p>

<p>She ends up at a dead end dominated by a piece of raw canvas that's been riveted to the wall, which displays the death of Simmons on an eternal loop.</p>

<p>She goes off somewhere else for a ladder and drill of the old hand-cranked variety.  She sets up the ladder and manually drills out every last rivet, taking the canvas down, though that leaves the wall bleeding.  She rolls up the canvas and carries it away.</p>

<p>She returns to the usual corner of her mindscape and as an experiment, she sets the painting of Reggie's final moments on fire, with magic.  It turns into smoke that fills the shadows surrounding her, which are actually her memories.  The return of that buried memory is painful, but it brings with it a flood of good memories that she'd been forced to bury with it, because they were connected.  She's finally able to look back on her time with Reggie, feeling joy.</p>

<p>She next lights the bloody canvas aflame, releasing the full pain of loss into her mind.  It really hurts, but she's ready to really deal with it and find a way forward.</p>

<p>Her inner demon (The Eighth Deadly Sin, Willful Insanity, or Insanity for short) hugs her in a surprising turn of events, because Insanity was born from the Hunter's Id, which is all about emotion.</p>

<p>Back in the real world, she tries to say, "I love you", though it comes out as "It's a secret."</p>

<p>Simmons responds, "I love you, too."</p>

<p>Mashu'ra also says goodbye and Simmons fades away.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Evie has grown translucent, because she's also fading!</p>

<p>Riley is upset, because he basically gained a daughter and now she's dying, in less than a day's time.</p>

<p>Evie tells them what she just realized: She didn't understand it at the time, but she's been dead for a great many years.  When she faced the demon that killed the monks, she blasted him with such a potent burst of life magic, she erased the demon magic in both her own body and that of the demon, killing them both.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of fairies (which is technically what the beings calling themselves demons in these novels are), Evie rose again in the same way Lara did in the previous book.</p>

<p>In the end, it hardly made a difference, because she'd never understood, until that morning, and the nature of her Spirit powers allowed her to freely cross the divide between the living and dead.</p>

<p>With her attachment to life fading, Evie is now ready to pass on.</p>

<p>Before she goes, she tells Riley something Evelyn told her: the woman he's been carrying a torch for feels the same, so he should marry her and have lots of kids.  He promised he'll soon have a daughter again.</p>

<p>He thanks her for that message.</p>

<p>The Hunter is sad, of course, because she'd been looking forward to visiting Evie from time to time, thinking they would be friends for thousands of years to come.</p>

<p>She tries and fails to express herself, saying, "It's a secret."</p>

<p>Evie smiles and slips back into her Chinese accent, "I ruv you, too."</p>

<p>She fades from sight, leaving a set of empty clothes behind.</p>

<p>After a scene break, the Hunter steps outside, in tears, mourning both Simmons and Evie, finally understanding the meaning of 'bittersweet'.  Looking back on her time with Reggie, however, she feels nothing but joy at having known him and the pain is gone, giving her confidence that she'll someday feel the same about Simmons.</p>

<p>Too distracted to pay attention, she bumps into a huge man in a biker's leather jacket and looks up at a squirrel's head!</p>

<h2>Part Four: Grounded</h2>

<p>Chapter 38 marks the end of Part Three and Chapter 39 will begin Part Four.</p>

<p>This part will cover the climax, in which the Hunter will face Ulmoch, leading to her capture, followed by a battle with Wrath and his arch demon wedding guests.</p>

<h2>Chapter 39: Chasing the Rabbit</h2>

<p>Ulmoch starts to tell the Hunter he's set a bomb on a timer, which will go off if she doesn't face him, only to realize, mid-sentence, he forgot to set the timer.  He tries to excuse himself, to go set it.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Hunter cuts his head off with her sword, intending to threaten him until he tells her where to find the bomb, but she's momentarily forgotten the fact such a wound won't disable Ulmoch's body (on her personal timeline, the last time she fought him was a couple years ago).</p>

<p>Ulmoch catches his head and runs off, while the Hunter gives chase.  He briefly trips on a bicycle (his head was facing the wrong way, because he was too busy talking), but loses no momentum, rolling down the sidewalk for a time.  Once his head is reattached, he leaps from one residential roof to another, while the Hunter flies after him.</p>

<p>Ulmoch uses hairpin turns to avoid her, while subtly navigating his way toward a low-rent area of Alice Springs.  He's more dexterous than she is and able to stay out of reach.  She tries using fire magic from her hands to turn better and starts to catch up, only for Ulmoch to accelerate, as if he's intentionally staying just out of reach.</p>

<p>Finally, he goes in a straight line and the Hunter thinks she's got him, only for him to drop between houses and enter one. She overshoots and smashes her way in through the front window, sending a hail of sharp fragments into Ulmoch!</p>

<p>He rolls sideways and ends up next to an old, hand-cranked record player, which is ready to go.  He starts it up and it crackles in the background as the Hunter catches him by the neck and slams him into the wall, putting her sword very near his eye.</p>

<p>She's so angry, her eyes glow an intense, blue shade.</p>

<p>Ulmoch surrenders and says he'll show her where the bomb is, if she'll let go of him.</p>

<p>She puts him down and he instead reaches into his jacket at high speed, yelling, "Psych!"</p>

<p>He produces the jar of liquid he's been saying he got as a present for her and throws it at the ceiling, where it smashes, causing the liquid to spatter down on the both of them!  It's LSD, by the way.  Nearly a whole pint of the stuff.</p>

<p>While Ulmoch sort of just accepts the high with pleasure, the Hunter stumbles around as the room becomes more colorful and spins around her, as if her head were mounted on a swivel.</p>

<p>She mutters, "It's a secret?" followed by her inner demon using her lips, "What the-" she finishes by cursing.</p>

<p>The next scene is inside the Hunters mindscape, where rainbows pieces the perpetual smoky shadows, chasing them away, while the sun shines from under the feet of the Hunter and Insanity.</p>

<p>Years of carefully maintained self-control by the Hunter erodes under the onslaught of the drugs, forcefully drawing her two halves together, where they splash and merge, like droplets of molten metal, reforming as a single individual.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sogliun has been watching the house from the other side of the street and is really surprised to see it melting like wax, while every color of light shines from within.  He analyzes the magic of the air, finding nearly every form of it he recognizes, though Void and Life magic are most prevalent.</p>

<p>He growls, "Ulmoch, what did you do?"</p>

<p>We switch back to the young woman having her first drug experience, but I pointedly don't refer to her as the Hunter.  In fact, she struggles with the very question of who she is.</p>

<p>She stands in a sunny field of grass and flowers, with rainbows flying like birds, surrounded by a landscape that's singing along to the song <em>White Rabbit</em>, by Jefferson Airplane.  The flowers sing soprano, the sun and rainbows are tenors, the stars of the sky sing alto and the ground itself produces a pleasant bass.  She initially thinks the cartoonish landscape is beautiful.</p>

<p>The song refers to Alice from <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em> and she comes to believe her name is Alice and the story her mother read to her as a child is her own story, while the memories that crawl around inside her skull, like ants, obviously are not her own (memories of the Hunter and Insanity).  That's a little hint that Alice is a brand-new personality, brought on by a drug overdose.</p>

<p>Having solved the identity issue, she looks at her magic clothes, which have gone absolutely berserk in response to her thoughts and feelings, unable to settle on a style or color.</p>

<p>She says, "Stop that" and her clothes settle on a long, blue dress with a white apron, a pair of fingerless, elbow-length gloves and a blue, silk top hat, while her hair turns blond and hangs loose.</p>

<p>She finally notices a pair of items in either hand, including a bit torn from a white mushroom cap and a bottle of dark liquid, labeled, 'DRINK ME'.</p>

<p>Feeling an urge to eat, Alice goes with the flow and bites into the mushroom.  As a result, she grows quite large.</p>

<p>From Sogliun's perspective, the house explodes into melted droplets as Alice shoots through the roof and the reality-warping power she's manifested rolls outward, spreading her reality-warping physical hallucination to the neighborhood!</p>

<p>Humans run in every direction and even Sogliun seeks distance, because he doesn't want to be caught up in it.</p>

<p>Naturally, he blames Ulmoch.</p>

<p>Alice decides she doesn't like being large and takes a swig of 'DRINK ME'.  It tastes mostly of fruit, but she can pick out a little turkey dinner mixed in.  She shrinks just as fast as she grew, ending up shorter than the grass, beside a caterpillar smoking from a hookah.</p>

<p>The Ulmoch-become-caterpillar asks, "How high am I?  This is like nothing I've ever seen!  Is this real or is reality as high I am?"</p>

<p>Realizing she overshot, Alice nibbles on the mushroom and returns to approximately normal size, finding herself standing beside a small apple tree covered in green apples, with a golden one near the top.</p>

<p>The dream-like beauty fades as the landscape turns hostile (the LSD is finally getting through her skin and her trip is turning bad, as a result) and the flowers grow fangs, trying to bite her ankles, though that doesn't matter, because she's wearing boots.</p>

<p>The rainbows, on the other hand, become a deadly problem as they swoop at her, their edges cutting her like razor blades!  Seeking to defend herself, she calls up the Hunter's wakizashi and deflects them.</p>

<p>As she fights, the landscape changes to a chess board on which a battle between the red and white armies takes place!  She realizes the rainbows were actually the men fighting and they only cut her by mistake.</p>

<p>The Red Queen screams, "Off with their heads!" to encourage her men and Alice, being in a drug-induced suggestible state, swings her sword as she spins like a ballerina.</p>

<p>The Ulmoch/caterpillar has apparently changed size along with her and loses his head to her twirl, complaining, "Oh, come on!  I thought we were finally getting along!"</p>

<p>She grabs Ulmoch's caterpillar head out of the air before he can catch it and hauls it out of reach.</p>

<p>The song reaches the last line and she takes it as an instruction.  Looking on the severed caterpillar head, she finds herself looking into the eyes of her own severed head.  She grabs the golden apple from the tree and forcefully rams it into the head's mouth, incidentally shattering teeth in the process.  With the stem facing toward her, she plucks it off and hurls the head away, because instinct tells her something energetic is about to happen.</p>

<p>Ulmoch's head sails out of the reality distortion and returns to normal.  So does the high-explosive anti-personnel grenade she called up from the Hunter's arsenal, which is inside his mouth.  It explodes and Ulmoch is sent home, where it takes him weeks to heal properly.  It was such a bad trip for him, he stays sober for three full months.</p>

<p>Feeling sick, Alice pukes, while the LSD dribbles form her clothes as they magically self-clean.  She finally lays down, to sleep off the high.</p>

<p>Solgiun notes the unreality bubble reversing course and it eventually vanishes, leaving most everything as it was before it appeared.  He reluctantly enters the house and finds Wrath's intended out cold, so he calls for pickup, quite surprised that Ulmoch actually succeeded in knocking her out.</p>

<h2>Chapter 40: Final Preparations</h2>

<p>Alice is captured by Wrath's minions, but in the process of getting her on a pallet with a binding circle on it, her hat falls off.  One of the demons tries to pick it up.  The hat eats them, both as the means to defend itself, but also to gain some extra energy.</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, the Hunter's father, Jake, gets the energy he needs to maintain the pocket dimension inside the hat from the Hunter, but when the hat is separated from her, he's on his own, so he uses the traces of demonic magic available to him to consume any demon that dares to touch it.</p>

<p>He needs the extra energy, lest he be forced to start discarding things stored inside, as he once did in 1972, throwing out dinner rolls to maintain sufficient energy.</p>

<p>In the next scene, Lara arrives at Riley's home, who tells her the Hunter left an hour earlier.</p>

<p>Lara summons Mashu'ra and he directs her toward the hat.</p>

<p>Alice arrives (still unconscious and captured) at Wrath's abandoned mine base, where Lust gets to work positioning the pallet holding her, in preparation to separate her human and demon sides.</p>

<p>In the background, Gluttony prepares the wedding feast (summoned imps), while a trussed-up justice of the peace awaits being of service, probably followed by being eaten.</p>

<p>Wrath makes arrangements for the other arches to be summoned and the wedding dress is brought in.  Lust tries to remove Alice's clothes, but fails, complaining that they must be glued on. Wrath gives it a go, literally trying to tear them off her, but only tears a small portion, which rapidly repairs itself.</p>

<p>Seeing the magic clothes at work, Lust suggests leaving them be (magic clothes aren't easy to make and can be very useful).  Wrath asks her to put the wedding dress on Alice over them.</p>

<p>Wrath heads off to get dressed and get his hair done, for the first time, ever.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lara arrives at the old wrecked house and puts on the Hunter's hat, surprised by the fact it has turned blue.</p>

<p>She uses the tracking curse Verda put on the Hunter and her hat in 1972 to learn the direction and distance to Alice.  Next, Lara grows bat wings and flies off (with Mashu'ra in her body, the animal forms she can use are limited to mammals).</p>

<h2>Chapter 41: Three for the Price of Two</h2>

<p>Alice finally wakes and looks around at the room, which has all seven arch demons in it.  She tries to leave, because it isn't her kind of scene, only to burn herself on the interior of the one-way force field produced by the binding circle.</p>

<p>She looks down and sees the wedding dress, but doesn't quite make the connection that she's the bride.  She's a little slow on the uptake, like a stoner normally is.</p>

<p>She notes the tuxedo Wrath is wearing and finally realizes she's at a wedding.  She looks down again and realizes she's supposed to be the bride.  The arches laugh at her exclamation of frustration.</p>

<p>She tries to escape with magic, but she's unable to accomplish anything.</p>

<p>Wrath orders her to hold out her left hand and she reasons she can't win, so she goes with the flow and obeys.</p>

<p>Wrath puts the enchanted engagement ring Lust made on her finger, resulting in Alice exploding into a cloud of black smoke.</p>

<p>Switching to Lust's perspective, she's surprised to see not two figures forming from the smoke, but three.  She's also somewhat bothered by her slowly-growing conscience, because she helped put her jailer (the Hunter/Alice) in this position.</p>

<p>Her calculations are all wrong and with three personalities instead of two, none of them will end up inside a binding circle.  She decides that with the plan so far off the rails, it's time to leave, but as she heads toward the exit, Gluttony sends three of her bodyguards after Lust, presumably to kill her.</p>

<p>Seeing no better option for survival, Lust plays into the desires of Greed, who's always had a thing for her, and buddies up to him, using a considerable share of charm magic to wrap him around her little finger.  It's a game she doesn't want to play, but it's better than the alternatives; Greed wishes to possess her, but the others likely want her dead for political reasons.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, manipulating the feelings of a man doesn't sit well with her, because she actually feels guilty about it.</p>

<p>The three figures solidify at the corners of a triangle, free, rather than on the two binding circle pallets that stood ready to catch them.</p>

<p>One is the mutated cat form of Insanity at full-strength, wearing the wedding dress, as planned.  The Hunter's human form is next, but she immediately collapses.  The last is Alice.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32: No Sanctuary</h2>

<p>The upstairs portion of the <em>The Last Sanctuary</em> turns out to be nothing but mummified corpses and they head downstairs, finding the great hall a little different.</p>

<p>First, the fire is much smaller and there's a sort of nest of orange monk robes laid out, where someone has been sleeping.  That's surrounded by little, hand-carved wood figures that are very artistic.</p>

<p>The bear statue has had a pair of glasses drawn on with charcoal and one whole wall is covered in charcoal drawings.  They start primitive at one end and slowly transition to being very well made, hinting at a progression over time.</p>

<p>The incense is all gone, presumably all used up.  The weapons and tools are rusty, but still serviceable, with sings someone has been looking after them.</p>

<p>Near the tree is a chopping block with an ax and carving knife (it's a magic tree that rapidly grows back, by the way, providing limitless wood for the fire).</p>

<p>The room smells of a child.  The Hunter moves closer and sniffs the nest, confirming they sleep there.</p>

<p>They're surprised to hear a child ask, from behind, "What are you doing?"</p>

<p>The Hunter turns to look, but no one's there.</p>

<p>The child points out, from behind, "I'm not there."</p>

<p>Whirling again only causes the kid to giggle from all directions.</p>

<p>Yet again from behind: "Who are you and what’s that rittle furry thing on your shourder?"</p>

<p>Note the spelling.  The kid pronounces L's as R's, using a Chinese accent.</p>

<p>The Hunter turns Mashu'ra around on her shoulder, so he can watch her back.</p>

<p>“You just gonna ignore me?” The child asks from every direction at once.</p>

<p>Tiring of the game, the Hunter closes her eyes, focusing her mind entirely on smell and magic.  As it turns out, the kid is using a technique very similar to the Hunter's shadow-stepping spell, but instead of a mix of Smoke and Void magic, to make shadow, the kid uses Void mixed with Life, forming a ghost-walking spell.</p>

<p>The Hunter gets an idea where the child is next to appear, based on smell and magic, grabbing their clothes.  The result is four years old, with brown eyes and a shaved head, in a child-sized orange robe.</p>

<p>Introductions reveal her name is Evie and it soon becomes clear the girl can see spirits and doesn't realize they're dead, because she asks "Who's the man in the gray suit?" and points at empty space.</p>

<p>They don't know, so she asks him and says he's "Crayton Simmons."  The Hunter is shocked by the revelation that Simmons is so very close, yet so far away.</p>

<p>Evie points all over the room at people her guests can't see, naming them, including a mixture of Western,m Chinese and Russian names, though the name 'Will' turned into 'Wirr', which will probably confuse, not that it matters.</p>

<p>Eventually, Evie asks why they're there and Mashu'ra tells her they're supposed to take her to her family.  She gets excited about it finally being time for "her adventure".</p>

<p>Like a child with a short attention span, she looks at the Hunter and asks if she ever speaks.</p>

<p>The Hunter nods and an amusing exchange happens, in which the Hunter intentionally baits Evie with the only phrase she can say, until she's annoyed the girl, getting her to ask, "Is that the only thing you can say?"</p>

<p>The Hunter nods and Evie grumbles, "That's annoying.  You're annoying!"</p>

<p>The Hunter is quite pleased at this outcome, because she tries very hard to be so.</p>

<p>Evie briefly tries to erase the Hunter's curse, but fails, because it's "rearry strong".</p>

<h2>Chapter 33: A New Lens</h2>

<p>The Hunter leaves the Sanctuary with Evie in two, surprised to see that the courtyard hasn't changed, but the scene across from it has.</p>

<p>The rope bridge now crosses a creek instead of a deep chasm.  The Hunter doesn't know it, but the Sanctuary connected them with an area near Alice Springs, Australia, because the magic of the Sanctuary sensed that was vaguely near where they needed to go.</p>

<p>The Hunter leaves the courtyard and steps onto the sandy bank of the Todd River.  The background is desert scrub brush, including sparse grass, low brush and hardy trees.</p>

<p>She looks back, but the Sanctuary and rope bridge are gone, leaving her in a very short panic, thinking she's lost Evie.</p>

<p>Evie steps out of thin air beside her, amazed by everything she sees.  After asking lots of questions, she wishes she could draw it, even though she left her "drawing warr" behind.</p>

<p>The Hunter gives her a clipboard with some paper and a box of crayons that came form the hat.</p>

<p>Evie draws the most violently-rainbow variation of the landscape, using every color she can, because she's never had colors to draw with before (she's used to charcoal).</p>

<p>After that, she draws it again, using more appropriate colors, and produces an image like unto a photograph, despite using only crayon.  She makes a gift of it to the Hunter.</p>

<p>She wonders aloud what's next and Mashu'ra is forced to admit he's not sure, so Evie asks her grandmother, reveling the fact that the spirits of the monks followed.</p>

<p>After a pause (our heroes can't hear Evenlyn speaking), Evie says, "Yeah?  I can do that."</p>

<p>She raises her arms and pours a mixture of Spirit and Void magic into the air, causing the landscape first to waver like a heat haze, then melt into a puddle like overheated crayons!</p>

<p>Mashu'ra and the Hunter get violently sick and she retches.  Rolling on her back, she looks up at some monks, Evenlyn included, plus Simmons, standing over her and discussing her illness.</p>

<p>The magic reverses and the melted landscape flows upward, into the shape and form of a hill they're now on top of, which give them a nice view of Alice Springs (though they still don't know where they are).</p>

<p>There's a brief conversation in which Mashu'ra asks Evie to warn them before she does that again.</p>

<p>Evie settles in to draw, while the Hunter starts to cry, because seeing Simmons ripped her half-healed wounds open again.  Evie notices her sobbing and hugs her (the Hunter's protective spells curiously don't stop that, indicating her mother refused to intervene).</p>

<p>Evie starts a discussion about the Hunter's tears and Mashu'ra tries to explain that she just lost a friend.  Evie doesn't understand and they begin a long conversation about death, but the Hunter suspects Evie will not understand, because unlike everyone else, she doesn't perceive the divide between the living and the dead.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34: No Home</h2>

<p>Close to an hour late, Mashu'ra has made no progress getting Evie to understand the concept of death and he tries saying, "Ghosts can’t be touched by the living."</p>

<p>Evie proves him wrong by shaking the hand of the unseen ghost of Simmons, though she unknowingly uses a little magic to pull that off.</p>

<p>Mashur'a gives up, "You’ll understand when you’re older."</p>

<p>They decide to enter the city, but just as Mashu'ra is saying he'll be fairly quiet, he vanishes, whisked away by Lara summoning him.</p>

<p>Evie gets an explanation from one of the ghosts haunting them, most likely Simmons, though the Hunter only hears half the conversation.</p>

<p>The girl leads the way into the city, following directions given by her grandmother.</p>

<p>They arrive at a brick house and Evie knocks.  A gruff-looking man answers, but smiles at Evie.</p>

<p>She asks if his surname is "Warrace".</p>

<p>He corrects her by saying "Wallace" and says yes.</p>

<p>Evie hugs his legs and says, "I ruv you, cousin!"</p>

<p>I've had a lot of fun with Evie's Chinese accent, so far, because it makes some of her words amusing and this struck me as one of the cutest things she's said so far.</p>

<p>The man pries her off and looks to the Hunter for an explanation, but Evie explains, "She can’t say much of anything, due to a magic curse."</p>

<p>The poor man looks at the both of them like they're insane and slowly back into his house, before shutting the door and presumably calling the police.</p>

<p>The Hunter grabs Evie's hand and takes here away from the place, while Evie asks if she did something wrong.</p>

<p>In the hunter's mind, it's more a matter of what she hadn't done wrong.</p>

<p>Again, one of the spirits explains, but this leaves the Hunter vaguely disquieted, because she isn't sure what they're telling the girl.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lara is in the New York branch office of the Order, helping with the cleanup and moving operation, while she waits.</p>

<p>She steps into Verda's office, noting the woman's bloodshot eyes, because she's hardly slept since Wrath exploded in her face.</p>

<p>They discuss Verda's fresh case of PTSD for a short while and Lara offers a little advice: Verda should go out and kill some weak demons, to do some good and reassure herself that she's not useless.</p>

<p>Verda agrees to try it.</p>

<p>There's also a brief internal momologue from Lara about her own experiences with PTSD (after she was rescued from Hell by her husband) and the way that very specifically didn't happen after she died and was transformed into a vengeful fey spirit, because fey don't get traumatized by death and instead seek revenge.</p>

<p>Verda asks if Lara has heard from Mashu'ra.  The answer is no, so Verda suggests Lara try summoning him again, even though only three hours have passed; she wishes Artemis were around.  That's a little hint that Verda would feel safe if Artemis were present, because she once killed Wrath.</p>

<p>Lara summons Mashu'ra into her body and relays recent events to Verda, who is very interested in <em>The Last Sanctuary</em>, which has been effectively sealed from the inside for 200 years.</p>

<p>Verda speaks of sending witches in through the "back entrance" to assess the place and get it running again.</p>

<p>Lara tells Mashu'ra she's on her way to Australia and releases him.</p>

<p>The scene ends with Verda asking if Lara needs a flight arranged.</p>

<p>Lara decides against it: “Nah.  Shooting Wrath into space gave me an idea I’ve been looking for an excuse to try…”</p>

<p>What she's referring to will be revealed, later.</p>

<p>Getting back to the hunter and Evie, they've tried three more distant relatives of the Wallace bloodline, who (sadly) want nothing to do with her, though they were polite about it and her childish enthusiasm is starting to fade and she grows slightly older (I mean this literally, not figuratively) with each rejection.</p>

<p>They bump into a young woman in the street that's eager to talk to them, because they're obviously foreigners.</p>

<p>Evie learns a few new words/phrases, including 'American', 'Australia' and 'the world', each requiring explanation and the Hunter produces a globe from her hat as a visual aid.</p>

<p>This leads the woman to make a joke, "You the magician or the little one’s lovely assistant?"</p>

<p>Amused, the hunter leans into the idea and pulls Mashu'ra from her hat, grateful he's back, because she doesn't entirely trust the ghosts to give Evie current and correct information, even though Evelyn, at least, is oddly up to date on where her family is.</p>

<p>She does a ventriloquist-like act, allowing Mashu'ra to talk in her place, which actually works a little too well, drawing attention.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Evie is confused, thinking the world and the globe are the same thing.</p>

<p>After an explanation of the difference, Evie shakes the globe and is very much relieved when it doesn't result in an earthquake.</p>

<p>The Hunter grows uncomfortable with the crowd she's accidentally drawn and leads Evie away.</p>

<p>When they're alone, Mashu'ra asks if they'd had any luck and Evie bursts into tears, because she feels like she has nowhere to belong.</p>

<p>The Hunter hugs the girl and finally realizes she's grown attached, much to her frustration.  She'd intended to get the job of delivering Evie to family done, without emotional involvement.</p>

<p>Mashu'a comforts Evie.  The Hunter also cries.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35: Family</h2>

<p>Evie and the Hunter are guided to several more homes of distant relatives by the ghost of Evelyn, but none of them works out, because the people in question have no room in their life for a random relative they didn't know existed.</p>

<p>They decide to quit for the night and Evie is directed by the ghost of Simmons to the local branch office of the Order.</p>

<p>They meet Riley Wallace, the man in charge of the place.  On hearing his name, Evie runs to him and after a short explanation, he hugs her. Riley admits he saw Evelyn in a dream, months earlier, in which she asked him to look after a girl.</p>

<p>He wasn't sure about the dream, but his own grandmother (a witch) advised him to do as he was told, so he prepared a room in his home for her.</p>

<p>It's a rather emotional moment when he tells Evie she has a home.  Evie is so happy, she cries profusely and thanks him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36: Brekky</h2>

<p>Lara is on a sub-orbital spaceflight, in the form of a missile, the quickest option she knows to get to Australia.</p>

<p>At the apogee of her flight, she admires the incredible view of both the Earth and the stars.</p>

<p>She falls back into the atmosphere and changes form, to give herself a heat shield, sacrificing some skin to handle the friction of re-entry.  Lara survives the friction burns and turns back into a missile for a while, performing a retrograde burn (reverse thrust) to slow herself down.</p>

<p>When the conditions are right, she turns into an eagle and flies to the ground, where she re-takes human form.</p>

<p>Her arms are badly burned and she's low on energy, so she lays down to relax and accidentally falls asleep.</p>

<p>Three aborigine men find her, two you fellows and one old guy.  They saw her come down like a shooting star and even watched her change shape.</p>

<p>The first hypothesis floated is that she's an angel, like some catholic guys once mentioned to them.</p>

<p>Next, they consider the possibility that she's a monster.</p>

<p>The old guy eventually decides that no angel or monster would look 
English and finally settles on a correct answer: she's a witch, a kind of magic foreigner woman.</p>

<p>They still debate what they should do, but ultimately decide to help her, because she's less likely to harm helpful people, on top of it being the neighborly thing to do.  They gather herbs and treat her wounds.</p>

<p>When she wakes, she's fully healed (mixture of medicinal herbs and her own regenerative magic).  The local men have gotten a fire going and they sit on the opposite side of it, eyeing her.  Not stated, but they put the fire between themselves and her as an extra measure of protection.</p>

<p>She thanks them and gets up to go, but her stomach growls and they kindly offer her brekky (Aussie slang for breakfast).</p>

<p>She's given a handful of live bugs to eat, including a fat caterpillar.  Not wanting to be rude, she actually eats everything, though it all tastes disgusting.</p>

<p>The two young guys roll on the ground with laughter, while the old one produces a can of beans, a small cooking pot and a can opener, which he's been hiding behind himself.</p>

<p>He asks, “Would ya like some beans, mate?  After what ya just ate, I can imagine ya’d like something normal to help ya forget.”</p>

<p>Lara can't help but laugh at their practical joke, while the old guy opens the can and dumps it in the pot.</p>

<h2>Chapter 37: Home at Last</h2>

<p>The Hunter waits for Evie to wake as morning arrives.  Evie sleeps in a bedroom setup by Riley, wearing pajamas that feature a little, black-furred, helicopter pilot kitty, flying through a sky filled with violently-colorful stars and rainbows that offend and wound the Hunter's sense of fashion.</p>

<p>Evie goes from having the body of a prepubescent twelve year old to that of a fifteen year old, having matured a bit more in the instant before she wakes.</p>

<p>The Hunter helps her dress, because she needs assistance with certain feminine undergarments that hadn't previously been necessary.  Riley stocked the closet of the bedroom with clothing ranging in age from infant to adult, because he didn't know the age of the girl he was to care for.</p>

<p>They step out of the bedroom, where Riley makes breakfast in the form of fried eggs.  Evie tries an egg and pukes ten minutes later, demonstrating her digestive tract is setup the same as the Hunter's.</p>

<p>Riley and Evie talk and the Hunter gets up to leave, because she's finally certain Evie will be safe and secure.  As the Hunter waves and opens the door to go, Evie finally comes to understand loss, in the form of losing a friend.</p>

<p>She begs the Hunter not to go and even offers to let her see Simmons if she'll stay, an obvious attempt at emotional manipulation.</p>

<p>A bargain is struck through gesture: the Hunter will stay for one day, then she leaves, regardless.</p>

<p>The spirits brow-beat Evie for her behavior and she apologizes to the Hunter for manipulating her feelings.</p>

<p>Eventually, Evie brings up the subject of death, because she wants to understand.</p>

<p>To address the subject, Riley takes them to a cemetery and the grave of his parents, who died in a car accident the year before.</p>

<p>He explains that their bodies are buried there and why (mostly cleanliness).</p>

<p>As a result of the conversation, he mentions "passing on" and Evie asks for an explanation of that concept.</p>

<p>Riley explains his views of the afterlife and a primitive variation of eternal joy vs. eternal punishment.</p>

<p>Evie asks why her friends haven't passed on and Riley suggests she ask them.</p>

<p>Riley and the Hunter step back, while Evie does exactly that, for quite some time.  Evie begins to cry at what she learns from them.</p>

<p>She returns to her living companions with a guilty expression and explains they haven't passed on, because she won't let them (it's a mixture of their own unfinished business, needing to see Evie safe and happy, plus her magic anchoring them to the living world).</p>

<p>She's deeply troubled by the idea of letting go of her friends.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26: …in the Depths</h2>

<p>The Hunter stirs from her recollections as a single-engine prop plane fights to climb above Everest, only for the door to be kicked open with demonic strength, allowing Ulmoch to jump out, while the plane crashes into the side of the mountain, causing an avalanche that consumes several climbers!</p>

<p>Naturally, the Hunter is furious and finally angry enough to kill him, but Everest isn't a good place for her to fight (too little energy), so she vanishes into a puff of smoke, shadow-stepping away.</p>

<p>Ulmoch and Sogliun have a conversation about the "gift" Ulmoch got for the Hunter and it's revealed to be a mason jar full of clear liquid, though Ulmoch won't explain any further.</p>

<p>Sogliun asks, "Do you have any idea how annoying you are?"</p>

<p>Ulmoch grins.</p>

<p>Sogliun laments, "I hate you."</p>

<p>After a scene change and a very long fall, the hunter touches down at the Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench.  She was forced to kill a giant squid along the way, because it tried to eat her.  She also saw an angler fish.</p>

<p>Her clothes have become a thick wetsuit, to keep her warm, and she uses the power of the Air Spirit to oxygenate her blood, since there's no air to breathe and the pressure is too high for a helmet.</p>

<p>Touching the sea floor produces a cloud of muck, so she chooses to swim.</p>

<p>She sees a hydrothermal vent in the distance and swims that direction, finding warmer water, a carpet of microorganisms and an occasional crab, plus some very unconventional fish.</p>

<p>She sees flowers in the distance and rushes over, discovering they're not actually flowers, but tube worms, with red at the top and white tubes they can withdrawn into, when threatened.</p>

<p>Staring at the tube worms, she settles on a boulder and stares at them as her mind wanders backwards, to a time and place full of red flowers.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27: Plain Sight</h2>

<p>Returning to the Hunter's flashback on her time in Canada with Simmons, they stand in a field of red daisies.</p>

<p>Simmons is lost and has been for hours, but has been refusing to admit it, while the Hunter finds it funny,  because he keeps turning his map at new angles.  He ends her amusement by finally saying it and asks if her nose tells her anything.</p>

<p>She takes a deep whiff and picks up the scent of smoke on the wind.</p>

<p>She leads them to a cabin between a dirt road and a forest, where a man chops wood.</p>

<p>Simmons introduces himself and the man says his name is Brady Roberts.</p>

<p>Simmons asks for directions back to civilization and the guy points to the south, saying, "About a hundred miles that way."</p>

<p>Seeing his expression and knowing they're on foot, Brady offers to get on the radio about their situation.</p>

<p>He spends about ten minutes inside and comes back out, saying he's spoken with their friends, who will be along tomorrow, because they had car trouble.</p>

<p>He passes along a message: "The abominable Snowman is still at large."</p>

<p>The Hunter recognizes the code name for the demon they're hunting, which means the monster evaded all nine teams, four of which had witches that were experts at tracking demon magic.</p>

<p>The Hunter's internal monologue reminds the reader of the peculiar demons from the summer camp incident (during events of the novella <em>She Goes to Summer Camp</em>), who were masked by magic that made them dang near impossible to detect with magic, even allowing them to pass the Hunter's sniff test.</p>

<p>Some few of those frog demons born on Earth were able to survive their mother's death, but only the very strongest, hinting that their quarry may be one of them.</p>

<p>Brady offers to put them up for the night.</p>

<p>Brady says "we" several times during the conversation, which will become an important point (he doesn't live alone).</p>

<p>They all go inside and Brady chatters away as if he's lonely (he is), giving them both some coffee.</p>

<p>The Hunter initially suspects Brady of being a magically masked demon and sniffs the coffee for poison, but finds it safe.</p>

<p>While Simmons and Brady talk, she decides she likes the smell of it and drinks some, as an experiment.  It makes her anxious and paranoid, with bloodshot eyes.</p>

<p>The Hunter eyes Brady with suspicion, thinking he's subconsciously tracing demonic symbols on his knee, then when he puts his head in his hand, she thinks his idle finger movements are designed to control some spell.</p>

<p>In essence, her imagination fills in the blanks on how his every action could be demonic.</p>

<p>Eventually, Brady comments on the way she's giving him the stink eye.  Simmons notices the way she's acting and the empty coffee mug, surprised she drank it.</p>

<p>He apologizes by pointing out the fact she's never had coffee before and Brady goes back to being generally friendly and good-humored, blowing it off as something like his own first mug at the age of 12 (up all night).</p>

<p>The Hunter turns a little introspective on the matter and decides she doesn't like coffee, vowing never to drink it again.</p>

<p>She also realizes it enhanced her natural paranoia (demons try to kill her quite often), until she found a human to be suspicious.</p>

<p>Brady's co-worker, Elijah, arrives and says, "The last of the seeds are-"</p>

<p>Brady interrupts, saying their guests don't need to know the boring details.</p>

<p>Elijah turns his head and stares at the Hunter with terror for a brief instant, but she chooses to ignore it, thinking it's another bit of coffee-induced paranoia.</p>

<p>She continually chooses to ignore warning signs from Elijah, until the man says it's time for bed (the light from outside is fading).</p>

<p>He gets a pair of sleeping bags from his room.</p>

<p>They say their good nights and our heroes bed down on the floor, while the Hunter pretends to sleep.</p>

<p>She focuses her mind (the coffee is helpful for keeping her mind on task) and pays close attention to her senses, just in case the things she's been seeing were real.</p>

<p>She assumes if one of their hosts is a demon, they'll attack in the night.</p>

<p>Hours pass in sheer boredom.</p>

<p>The Hunter is vindicated when Elijah exits his room in frog demon form and opens his mouth extra wide, to swallow her whole.</p>

<p>She swings her sword sideways, out of the sleeping bag, and puts the tip to the soft bits at the roof of the frog demon's mouth, just below his brain.</p>

<p>She wakes Simmons and an interrogation session begins.</p>

<p>The demon initially refuses to cooperate, so the Hunter cuts his arms off.  They don't evaporate like usual, by the way.</p>

<p>He blubbers and begs, agreeing to answer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, just as he starts an explanation, he drops dead.  Like his arms, he doesn't evaporate, because he's a leftover frog demon from <em>She Goes to Summer Camp</em>, which were spawned on Earth and have much more physical/less magical forms than the garden variety of demon.</p>

<p>Brady walks in, having been woken by the commotion, screaming at the sight of the corpse, asking if it's an alien.</p>

<p>The Hunter drags the dead demon outside, while Simmons explains, being honest.</p>

<p>The Hunter buries the body in the woods.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28: Perspective</h2>

<p>Lara has setup camp, including a tent, camp chair and a steel barrel with a fire in it, but the odd part is where she is: the underside of the Whitestone bridge, in New York City.</p>

<p>She used a spell to made the underside of the bridge attract things, similar to gravity, so she hangs upside-down, above the East River.</p>

<p>Unable to sleep, she decides to enjoy the fire and roast some marshmallows.</p>

<p>To that end, she uses her shape-changing magic to turn her finger into a a long, steel wire, similar to that of a roasting fork.</p>

<p>She impales three marshmallows on it and roasts them, only for Ulmoch to interrupt, saying, "Neat trick!"</p>

<p>Naturally, she turns her arms into Tommy guns and opens fire as Ulmoch leaps her direction!</p>

<p>He dodges her bullets until he reaches the attraction spell, losing his balance!</p>

<p>Ulmoch is riddled full of holes until he starts moaning with pleasure about how good it feels, causing Lara to stop, bothered by his masochism.</p>

<p>He reveals the existence of the bounties on both her head and that of the Hunter.  He even tells her that Wrath is "in love" with the Hunter.</p>

<p>He spits out bullets several times along the way, especially when he laughs, because his lungs are full of them.</p>

<p>Laura kills him, collects her things and flies off, letting the corpse fall into the East River.</p>

<p>Sogliun watches Lara fly off, feeling suspicious about Ulmoch's motives.  After all, he works for Pride and he only paid Sogliun to find Lara once, rather than a long-term deal like he negotiated to find the Hunter.</p>

<p>The smoky demon can't help but wonder what's really going on...</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lara sets down in an alley and summons Mashu'ra, demanding to know where the Hunter is.  He tells her the truth: bottom of the ocean, meaning she's out of reach (Mashu'ra can't survive where she is).</p>

<p>Mashu'ra offers to deliver a message, once he can safely pop out of the hat.</p>

<p>Lara explains everything she just learned, though it's left as a trailing sentence, to avoid repetition and loss of reader interest.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29: …in Meditation</h2>

<p>The Hunter's private thoughts are interrupted by the roar of a great cat, despite being at the bottom of the Pacific, and her mind is filled with the sound of animals of every shape and size.</p>

<p>By entering a place only inhabited by animals, she's drawn the attention of the Animal Spirit, which wishes to punish her for holding its siblings captive.</p>

<p>The Hunter puts out her light and shadow-steps away.</p>

<p>In the next scene, she's high in the mountains, fighting a blizzard.  She's undeterred, because she enjoys the challenge.  This is the third mountain she's searched for a place she heard about in rumor, in the halls of the New York branch office of the Order, which is supposed to be very quiet and peaceful.</p>

<p>She turns a corner of the mountain and sees the broken rope bridge leading to her destination.  She doesn't give up and flies.</p>

<p>The wind nearly knocks her form the air several times, because the blizzard is that intense, but she reaches the walled courtyard of an ancient temple, setting down in the crunching snow.</p>

<p>In an instant, the weather is clear and the mounds of snow covering the place are gone.  She looks with confusion at the intact rope bridge.</p>

<p>Her senses tell her that the fading magic she feels was an Illusion she just pierced.</p>

<p>The temple doors open and orange-robed, bald monks invite her to enter.</p>

<p>Inside, the tile floor depicts the elements of witch magic in grand fashion: air, earth, fire, water, smoke, metal, wood, animal, life and the void.  It even has some small, nearly missed symbols representing the void-touched elements: vacuum, shadow, the all-consuming (ultraviolet) flame, poison, ash, bone, ice and blood.</p>

<p>She's welcomed to <em>The Last Sanctuary</em> and told she's been expected for some time.</p>

<p>She's surprised, because no one was told she was coming, though the monks are Ashen Blades.</p>

<p>The monk says, "The Master of the sanctuary would like to speak with you, but she’s very old and currently sleeping.  We will inform you when she’s ready.  For now, relax.  Meditate on the peace and comfort you seek.”</p>

<p>The Hunter is curious to learn more, but for once, she's willing to be patient, because she has her own issues to focus on.  She settles in by the fire and stares into it, letting her mind wander to the past.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30: Questioning</h2>

<p>The Hunter returns to the cabin as Simmons puts some fresh logs into the wood stove.  (purely there for another cinematic fade)</p>

<p>Simmons questions Brady, because he has his doubts about the man being human, but isn't convinced he's a demon, either.</p>

<p>He reasons for a time about Brady, tallying points of evidence in his mind as they talk about the dead demon.</p>

<p>After a while, Simmons settles on an approach that occurred to him just before the last frog demon he hunted revealed themselves.</p>

<p>He claims he needs more information about Brady for his records and begins a formal interview over Brady's identity, eventually dovetailing into a psychological questionnaire, during which he asks Brady to close his eyes and say the first thing that comes to mind.</p>

<p>Eventually, Simmons throws in this question: "How long have you been on Earth?"</p>

<p>Brady answers, "Seven years."</p>

<p>Even Brady realizes what Simmons just did, though he's too late to take it back and drops the illusion of humanity, reveling himself to be a huge, muscular frog demon, much larger than average (all that wood chopping must have paid off).  I like to think of Brady as a lumber-jack demon.</p>

<p>At the same time, Simmons mutters, "Mashu'ra!"</p>

<p>The two of them explode out the side of the cabin!  Incidentally, this scares a moose that wandered by the cabin.</p>

<p>They end up lying prone as Simmons sinks the claws of his hands in and rakes with his back feet!</p>

<p>The frog takes the worst of it and begs for his life, bringing the fight to a close.  He's been halfway disemboweled and is quite helpless for the time being.</p>

<p>Simmons gets some answers: the demons were spreading their offspring (the demon pretending to be Elijah was female) in nearby lakes and rivers and Brady was the strongest of them, having taken over the hivemind, after the death of their mother.</p>

<p>As the demon begs for his life, Simmons crushes his head with a foot.</p>

<p>Simmons drags the body into the woods, for burial, while the Hunter watches him go, glad she accepted human companionship and grateful Simmons is so strong and smart, more or less the perfect partner for her work.</p>

<p>She reasons he'll never die by anything other than natural causes and that fate is surely thousands of years away.</p>

<p>She's content that with him by her side, she'll always be happy.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31: …Anywhere</h2>

<p>The Hunter is stirred from her memories by Mashu'ra appearing on her shoulder, to deliver news of the things Lara learned.</p>

<p>The Hunter is disgusted by the idea than Wrath wants to marry her, making fake retching noises.</p>

<p>The kitten demon asks if she'd be willing to stand beside Lara, to face the bounty hunters together and she agrees.</p>

<p>As she holds Mashu'ra and pets him, she concludes she's done wandering, ready to face her grief with a friend by her side.</p>

<p>She still doesn't know how to cope with the idea of eventually losing all of her human friends, but she's ready to look for that path forward.</p>

<p>One of the monks politely interrupts and tells her, "The Master of the Sanctuary will see you now."</p>

<p>He leads the way toward the spiral stairs around the central column of the room (I did some editing to add it).</p>

<p>I like the implication of that column and its stairs: the way up (enlightenment) requires walking the path of life.</p>

<h2>Part 3: Losing Buoyancy</h2>

<p>The end of chapter 31 marks the end of Part 2.</p>

<p>Part 1, Untethered, was about Reggie and setting the stage with Wrath.</p>

<p>Part 2, Tossed on the Wind, was about Simmons and the Hunter's journey as she learns to grieve, instead of stuffing her feelings.</p>

<p>Part 3 will focus on her journey toward acceptance of loss as part of the cycle of life as she cares for a young child.</p>

<p>Part 4, Grounded, will focus specifically on the climax and conclusion of the conflict with Wrath.  It will also bring the Hunter and Lara back together, with a stronger bond than ever.</p>

<p>The names of each part evoke the journey of a balloon and the grief of a child at losing it, as a metaphor for loss.  The balloon represents Simmons and the child represents the Hunter.</p>

<p>First the balloon is accidentally released, leading to a crying fit, then the child watches their toy as it's buffeted by the wind and blown away, though they still feel the loss.  Eventually, the balloon loses helium and starts to come down, while the child moves on with their life.  Finally, the balloon comes back down to the ground, but by that point, the child has usually either forgotten their balloon or accepted the idea they'll never get it back.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32: No Sanctuary</h2>

<p>Mashu'ra and the Hunter are led to the old witch in charge, Evelyn Wallace, who speaks with an Australian accent.</p>

<p>She tells them a little about <em>The Last Sanctuary</em>: it's a magical place like <em>The Cauldron of the Elements</em>, but unlike that place of nature, it's a made thing, made by witches.  It's also a pocket dimension, accessible from anywhere.</p>

<p>Evenlyn tells them a tale about an Ashen Blade witch that fought a war against a demon that sought to oust Pride from his throne, by destroying the world before Pride's circuitous portal-to-hell plan could be realized.</p>

<p>Eventually, this witch sought more power, that she might win, and summoned Pride/Vogerath, reasoning that "the enemy of my enemy is my friend."  She made a deal with him and became a demon witch, but part of the bargain was that she would bear a child.</p>

<p>Internally, she vowed to never do so.  After all, in her era, women were not well respected as they are now and she hated them.  She was also very head-strong, as witches tend to be, too much so to accept a man.  Ironically, her personal pride may have been her downfall.</p>

<p>She won her war against her personal nemesis, but was rejected by the Ashen Blades, for having willingly become a demon.</p>

<p>She wandered and sought solace in strong drink.  At one point, she lay drunk in the street and was raped, leading to pregnancy and birth of a daughter.</p>

<p>Determined to keep the baby safe, she sought <em>The Last Sanctuary</em>, but not for herself.  In truth, the place cannot be found by a demon, though it will become apparent there is still one way they can find their way in, through the human heart.</p>

<p>She couldn't find the way, but her infant pointed the way and she reached the threshold.  Evelyn met her there and refused entry.</p>

<p>The witch explained how she'd gotten there.  Evelyn accepted the child and started to ask the witch to leave, but she'd already turned away.</p>

<p>Evelyn admits, through tears, that she turned her own daughter away, implying the half-demon infant was her granddaughter.</p>

<p>Mashu'ra asks how long ago the child was born and is told, "After your old master freed Pride to return to Earth, but before your current master was born."</p>

<p>Mashu'ra doesn't believe her,  because that would make Evelyn far older than the Hunter, who was born 126 years earlier!</p>

<p>Evenlyn says, "Aren’t you a clever little imp?"</p>

<p>The Hunter blinks involuntarily and the room goes dark.</p>

<p>When she gets a magic light going, she looks on the corpse of Evelyn, who's clearly been dead for decades, if not centuries.  The room is also full of cobwebs, which incidentally block the way out.</p>

<p>The ghost of Evelyn touches their minds, saying, "Take my granddaughter to my family, in Australia.  It’s time she finally grew up a little."</p>

<p>They explore the place, finding many more bodies, all with signs of violence, ranging from blade wounds, to teeth and claws.</p>

<p>Mashu'ra investigates one of them, concluding it's the work of a fairly unique demon that goes by the name Muglon, who had a way of getting into any human head, because he didn't favor any given sin.</p>

<p>Worse, Muglon was/is able to jump from body to body, possessing humans with ease, not even requiring them to fully succumb to their sins, in order for him to fully possess them.</p>

<p>He was a generalist.  It isn't stated, but Muglon was actually using the insanity basis of sin as the means into the human mind, so any sin at all was a doorway for him.</p>

<p>It's implied that one of the monks committed some sin that brought Muglon to the sanctuary and that was their downfall, leading to fighting.</p>

<p>This chapter isn't done, but I'll continue it on Monday.</p>

<h2>Future Plans</h2>

<p>The final elements of the novel are now fairly sharp in my mind and I have a strong idea of how the climax will shape up, but as ever and demonstrated by Chapter 32, all things are subject to change.</p>

<h3>The Child</h3>

<p>I'd originally planned to saddle the Hunter with a totally human child, but now know she'll be dealing with a half-demon girl, who's much like her.</p>

<p>This child has potent abilities, with a particular focus on Life magic.  She's most talented with Spirit magic.  The reason the Hunter initially saw the Sanctuary as it appeared in the past is because the child was the one to kill the demon and she was left alone, so she summoned the spirits of her fallen friends, to keep her company.  With so many strong ghosts around, reality was warped to make the present appear like the past, up until Mashu'ra pierced the illusion with cold logic.</p>

<p>Since she's mentally three or four years old, when asked about the demon, the girl's explanation will be, "I made it go away."</p>

<p>The real truth will be that she either ate it or hit it with such a potent blast of pure life magic, it was unmade.  Ironically, while demons use Life magic to enter the human mind, it's also antithetical to their core nature and can be quite dangerous to them.  Ironically, if Verda knew that (she doesn't), she'd blast away.</p>

<p>The Hunter will take the child to Australia and over the course of days, they'll search for her still-living family, while the child grows older, the more she learns.</p>

<p>Half-demons don't mature at the usual pace of humans and their outward appearance changes to match their internal state.  That's why the Hunter has grown mature so slowly, but in sharp spurts.  It's also why she'll probably always look like a teen; if I have any say in the matter, she will never lose her childish nature, which will keep her young.</p>

<p>By the time they find the girl's family, she'll be an adult.  She'll spend a few hours with them, then rapidly grow older, until she's a withered, old woman.  She'll die happy and content.  The reason for this is that her Spirit magic gives her a very strong connection to and understanding of spirits and with her final desire in life complete, she's ready to face the great beyond.</p>

<p>My intent in this is that the Hunter will slowly grow to love this girl, thinking she'll be a friend she can keep forever, only to see her hopes dashed, but in seeing her friend pass on, she'll come to realize that life isn't about the destination, but rather the journey along the way.</p>

<p>She'll come away from the experience with an acceptance of that journey and view her friends in a new light: she'll value the limited time she has with them, rather than worrying about the pain of losing them.</p>

<p>She'll also fully accept the name Simmons gave her in the previous book, coming to think of herself as Artemis Watson.  She hasn't been using it, because it's been a painful reminder that he's gone.</p>

<h3>The Climax</h3>

<p>The final events of the novel will happen quickly, once the half-demon child is gone.  The Hunter will be in some city of Australia, where Ulmoch will catch up to her.  He'll lead her on a merry chase, until she bursts into a place he's prepared to fight her.</p>

<p>As she bursts in, he'll open her "present", which is a jar with at least a pint of LSD in it, splashing it all over the both of them.  He hopes the massive dose will mess her up so badly, that she'll either pass out or try to sleep off the hallucinations.</p>

<p>I don't want to spoil the outcome, just yet, but it both will and won't go according to plan.  He'll be killed, of course, but that doesn't matter very much.</p>

<p>She'll eventually lay down to sleep it off and that's when Wrath's people will capture her.  They'll take her to Wrath and he'll summon the guests (the other arch demons).</p>

<p>Lust's plan to split the Hunter in two will work, but not quite as expected, due to a recent change in her mental landscape, ruining all of Lust's calculations about her final position(s) and the Hunter won't appear in the binding circles Lust prepared.</p>

<p>Lara will show up about the same time and all heck will break loose.  The Hunter's inner demon and Lara will form a brief alliance, in which they cut loose at full strength on both Wrath and the arches, enjoying the target-rich environment.</p>

<p>Incidentally, Wrath will get his head punched off by the demon, landing far away, in the outback.  As he lays there, helpless, Pride will come along.  Wrath will request help (he can't move his body without his head attached) and Pride will eat him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Hunter's human side will be far too sick to function, because she lacks some vital (human) DNA and cellular machinery that had been replaced by her demon side.</p>

<p>Then comes the part I haven't quite figured out, yet: how will the Hunter be put back together?  The demon will resist, because it wants to be free, and Lara will be smacked aside, once they reach that disagreement.</p>

<p>The Hunter will probably be forced to fight the demon, sick or not.  The power of the elemental spirits in her head will help (they stayed with her human half, because they despise the demon, based on the way she once ate the Water Spirit).</p>

<p>It will probably take the combined efforts of Lara, Mashu'ra, the Hunter, her parents and a character I don't want to spoil coming together, as a team, with each of them holding one piece of the puzzle.  It will probably have to happen inside the Hunter's hat.</p>

<h3>The Ending</h3>

<p>Lara and the Hunter will go home together, each vowing to be more sensitive to the feelings of the other.  I think the epilogue might involve the Hunter learning to care for Lara's son, James, so she can serve as his babysitter and give Lara a break from time to time.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19: Confluence of Sin</h2>

<p>I continued this chapter from where I left off, last week.</p>

<p>After seeing the 1000 soul bounty posted for the Hunter's capture, Ulmoch contacts Pride to ask permission to accept the contract.  Pride says yes, but also requires him to do exactly as he says...</p>

<p>I intentionally left his instructions to the imagination, but they'll become apparent during the climax.</p>

<p>From there, I did wedding invitations:</p>

<h3>Gluttony</h3>

<p>Gluttony is in her throne room, which she's combined with a corporate conference room, for modern times, all decorated with obsidian and gold, with a boardroom style table at the center.</p>

<p>She's slimmed down for modern times and wears a gray business suit with a skirt. Corporate overspending and waste are the modern equivalent to eating too much.</p>

<p>Her modernization started with a conspiracy between light bulb manufacturers making their products disposable, but that spread to making <em>everything</em> disposable, with plastic being a huge part of that.  In her internal monologue, the oil tycoons were wasteful on their own, needing little demonic push.</p>

<p>She sits at her huge table, which has been set with a meal consisting of three live imps, in the form of a boar, a turkey and a piglet, all tied up.</p>

<p>Each has been condemned to death by Gluttony for refusing to be her meal (that's what they were raised for).  Ironically, the outcome is the same.</p>

<p>Just as she raises the piglet to bite, an illusion of Sergeant Thilvod (the stag demon Sogliun spoke with to get an appointment with Wrath) appears.</p>

<p>He invites Gluttony to Wrath's wedding.  There's some discussion of catering (Wrath hasn't done this yet) and Gluttony offers to provide the food, mostly so she can avoid Wrath dumping a box of MREs on the food table, which is exactly what he would have done, if left to his own devices.</p>

<p>I have plans for Gluttony in a later book, so this serves as a bit of foreshadowing.</p>

<h3>Greed</h3>

<p>Greed is in his own throne room, which is also his treasury.  He dresses somewhat like a street-level member of a gang, but with far more expensive clothes, including a pistol in his waistband and some gold chains.  The only odd bit is his tricorn hat, a fond left-over from the days he was a pirate.</p>

<p>He's busy using a laptop from the human world, which is connected to the internet via a gremlin-possessed DSL modem.</p>

<p>His plans involve pouring magic into the internet, but it isn't explained.  Again, I'm doing a little foreshadowing for a later book.</p>

<p>He's also interrupted by Sergeant Thilvod inviting him to the wedding.</p>

<h3>Envy</h3>

<p>Envy is next, but I carefully pointed out to the reader that Envy is actually one of Pride's bodies in disguise, because he ate her in 1972, during the second book.</p>

<p>He/she wears a ring that blocks that particular body from being tracked by the Thaumavore, a unique trinket he can't reproduce.</p>

<p>Sergeant Thilvod appears and invites Envy to the wedding.</p>

<h3>Sloth</h3>

<p>Sloth is woken by a servant.  He appears as a puddle of foul, black slime at the center of a circular room lined with shelves.  Those hold crystals that change shape and color over time, because they're physical manifestations of the dreams of humanity.</p>

<p>Sloth manipulates humans through their dreams, mostly in a for-hire fashion, the most famous example of which are Lust's succubi.</p>

<p>Sloth himself, on the other hand, favors driving men mad in their dreams.  He admits to himself that he recognizes the existence of the eighth deadly sin, willful insanity, because he uses it in his work.</p>

<p>Thilvod has appeared to invite Sloth to the wedding.  Sloth is happy to hear the news, because he and Wrath are friends; when people go mad, they often start killing, so he and Wrath work hand in hand on those cases.</p>

<p>With the invitation extended, the image of Thilvod vanishes and Sloth yells for lots of coffee, because he doesn't want to sleep through Wrath's summons, when the time comes.</p>

<h3>Pride</h3>

<p>When Thilvod appears to Pride, he smugly interrupts, "Of course I’ll go to my old friend’s wedding, just so long as it’s on Earth.  I’m not returning to Hell until the Thaumavore is dead.  When and where?"</p>

<p>Thilvod tells him, "The Australian Outback.  I’ll provide more exact coordinates when the time is right."</p>

<h2>Chapter 20: …in the Rainforest</h2>

<p>The Hunter's thoughts are interrupted by the crazed cry of Ulmoch, who was brought to Giza by Sogliun.  As it turns out, Sogliun can track the very distinctive feel of her life energy, which he's more sensitive to than any other demon.</p>

<p>She's not in the mood, so she flies off, while Ulmoch tries to taunt her into a fight.</p>

<p>In the next scene, the Hunter slashes her way through the Amazon rainforest, comparing it to the jungles of Vietnam.</p>

<p>She stumbles on an ancient, Aztec city, which includes a pyramid, a fact that amuses her, because she thought she'd left pyramids behind, in Egypt.</p>

<p>She climbs on the roof of the temple at the top and sits on the corner, admiring the view, because she can see pretty far, including the Amazon river as it winds back and forth.</p>

<p>Her mind is drawn to the past, to her time with Simmons in the jungles of Vietnam.</p>

<p>Between this and the opening of the next chapter, this would make for a nice cinematic dissolve, were it done in a TV show or movie, transitioning from a view of the rainforest to a view of the jungle.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21: The Last China Shop</h2>

<p>The Hunter and Simmons are in the jungles of Vietnam, in 1973, on their last search and destroy mission in the country, accompanied by Staff Sergeant Greer and his men, the long-range patrol that stayed with them while they were there.</p>

<p>She sniffs out a demon nest Verda located on a map with magic.</p>

<p>There's a brief disagreement between Simmons and the Hunter over who goes inside first, since the cave entrance is only wide enough for one at a time, so they decide to settle it with a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.</p>

<p>However, Simmons (correctly) accuses her of cheating; she's been using her extremely-fast mind and reflexes to read his muscles before he moves, so she can choose a winning move, every time.  It only worked because she's known him for thirty years, demonstrating how well she reads him.</p>

<p>Simmons insists they both close their eyes to make the game fair and the Hunter reluctantly obeys.  She chooses scissors and Simmons goes with rock, so he gets to go first.  Naturally, she's very annoyed, since she's always been a sore loser, but she lets it go, because it's Simmons.</p>

<p>They enter the cave, while Simmons unwisely uses a flashlight (tunnel rats didn't use flashlights unless they had to, because the Viet Cong were used to working in total darkness, so a light would give the enemy the advantage).</p>

<p>Simmons takes full-auto AK-47 fire from three demons, but isn't permanently affected, spitting out some slugs, while the rest fall off his magic suit, which can shrug off small arms fire.  He goes total ape-crap on one demon (the pain forced him into a berserk fit), while the Hunter dispatches the other two with a bit of swordplay.</p>

<p>They head deeper inside, while the Hunter considers how happy she is to have such an indestructible partner.</p>

<p>When they emerge from the cave, they're informed it's time to head back to the world (Army slang for home/out of the war), because Verda says they've wiped out the last nest they can reasonably reach.</p>

<p>The Hunter considers the meaning of 'home', realizing she was never homesick in Vietnam, because she'll always feel at home with Simmons by her side.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22: Rescue</h2>

<p>Wrath rescues Lust and takes her to the abandoned mine that serves as his current base in the Australian Outback.</p>

<p>They discuss what he wants from his relationship with the Hunter, coming to some conclusions:</p>

<ul>
<li>She will never be willing and would rather kill him.</li>
<li>He wants a long-term relationship, not a single night.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lust forms a plan accordingly, which consists of an enchanted engagement ring that will force the Hunter to split in half by forcing the activation of the power she stole by eating Pride during previous books.</p>

<p>The ring will cause the Hunter to split into her human and demon halves, each of them pure and unsullied by the other.</p>

<p>The next half of Lust's plan involves an enchanted wedding band that will bind the demon's will to Wrath, so he can order her to love him.</p>

<p>Before Wrath leaves to obtain the required supplies, Lust's stomach growls, so he asks Thilvod to bring her a meal, a living human being.</p>

<p>At the end of the previous book, Lust was given a copy of the Book of Mormon, which she's been reading a bit here and there in this book.  She reached 3 Nephi 11 at the start of the chapter and felt something powerful as a result (the presence of the Holy Ghost).</p>

<p>Seeing her "meal", Lust is disgusted by the thought of killing and eating the man.  She refuses, claiming she's gotten used to the taste of beef during her incarceration (a half-truth), though she picks her words very carefully, lest Thilvod suspect her of feeling compassion, which demons have been known to kill each other over.</p>

<p>Thivold takes the man away and returns with some MREs that feature beef.  Lust eats while working on calculations related to her enchanting work.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23: …on Top of the World</h2>

<p>The Hunter's thoughts are once more interrupted by the voice of Ulmoch, causing her to groan as he leaps from the trees to the roof the the temple she's sitting on.</p>

<p>She immediately flies off, while he tells her he got her an expensive present, which required killing a lot of "guys he liked" to obtain.</p>

<p>Her response is to go super-sonic.</p>

<p>In the next scene, the Hunter climbs Everest, hoping the remote location will keep everyone away from her.</p>

<p>She sits at the peak and stares at the horizon as the chapter ends.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24: Airdrop</h2>

<p>Were this a movie, I imagine a dissolve from one horizon to another, though with a military plane in the air (the kind used for airdrops).</p>

<p>It's 1989 and the Hunter is in a military plane in the air above Canada, preparing to parachute to the ground, because there's a demon hiding somewhere in a remote and snowy mountain range.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Hunter is sick and on her fifth barf bag, since the combination of low life energy and the motion of a plane get her every time.</p>

<p>Simmons gleefully jumps out of the plane with a whoop of delight, because being indestructible has made him adventurous.</p>

<p>The Hunter nervously steps up to jump, but hesitates, because her last drop from a plane went badly.  The plane hits some turbulence and she loses her balance, falling out of the plane before she's ready!  She screams and panics, forgetting what she's supposed to do!</p>

<p>She passes Simmons on the way down, since he's got his limbs wide, to slow down, so he angles himself through the air (he's gone skydiving many times before) to catch up to her, yelling for her to calm down.</p>

<p>They link up in the air and Simmons pulls her ripcord for her, ensuring her safety.</p>

<p>As he turns to look back down, he realizes he's too late to pull his own ripcord and screams, "Mashu'ra!"</p>

<p>He hits the ground mid-transformation to his cat-man form, but that's enough to save his life.</p>

<p>The Hunter lands and rolls back to her feet in one fluid movement, only to get hit in the face by her parachute, which pulls her off her feet and drags her on the wind!</p>

<p>She cuts herself free with her sword.</p>

<p>She follows her nose to Simmons, finding him groaning at the bottom of a small crater in the snow, with all four limbs badly broken.  She helps him by lining his bones up, while Mashu'ra's power heals him.</p>

<p>When he's done healing, he releases Mashu'ra and returns to normal size.</p>

<p>The Hunter can't smell any trace of demon and they conclude they're in the wrong place.  There were eight other teams being dropped all over the range, so no big deal.</p>

<p>Simmons produces a map and leads the way.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25: Safe and Secure</h2>

<p>Lara enters the Cauldron of the Elements, the same remote valley the Hunter sought some peace and quiet in.</p>

<p>Lara is worried that Wrath is coming to kill her and came to the valley, because she can think of no safer place to leave her son.</p>

<p>She bumps into Ignacio Greer, who settled there after the events of <em>She Goes to Summer Camp</em>.</p>

<p>They discuss current events, including Artemis (another name for the Hunter) being missing and Greer explains that Macie saw her in the valley, seemingly looking for some peace and quiet.</p>

<p>Lara explains her current situation and her worries, asking Greer and Macie to care her son.</p>

<p>Greer accepts and assures her that James will be looked after (Greer helped his Mom care for three younger brothers).</p>
