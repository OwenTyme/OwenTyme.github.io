<p>The Ebook of the fifth and final volume of <a href="../books/wizards-scion/index.html">The Wizard's Scion</a> is now available for pre-order and will be released on December 13.  Sadly, it took far longer than I originally planned for, but better late than never, I suppose.</p>

<p>In the bad news column, I'm now lacking the services of a professional artist, though I'm waiting on a reply from another I contacted.  In the neutral column, I made this cover myself, by heavily leaning into metaphors for the plot.  I used public domain vector art and a nice nebula image from the James Webb Space Telescope, if I remember correctly.  Someday, the art may be replaced with something better.  In the good news column, the advantage of this new approach is that you'll be seeing my novels published far faster than in the past.</p>

<p>The wraparound cover for the print edition of <a href="../books/wizards-scion/the-inverted-glass.html">The Inverted Glass</a> is my next side project, which I'll probably be able to finish tomorrow.</p>

<p>The omnibus edition of <a href="../books/wizards-scion/index.html">The Wizard's Scion</a> should also be coming soon, but I have to assemble a set of metaphors that work with the art available to me with my admittedly not-great art creations skills.  I'm primarily a cut and paste artist, but I've got a good eye for both visual metaphors and art in general, so it's just a matter of time before I find something that works.</p>

<p>I hope to get through the majority of my backlog of novels in the next couple of months.  In particular, I'll be starting final editing of the prequel series, <a href="../books/sky-children/index.html">Sky Children</a>, later this week, since I already have the artwork done for the first two books.  The second book will follow shortly after.  The third book will have to wait until later, because it's still badly in need of a total rewrite.</p>

<p>In short, keep your eyes peeled and hang onto your seat, because things are about to significantly speed up.</p>

<p>Without further adieu, I present to you:</p>

<h2>The Inverted Glass</h2>

The Steel Wizard, Captain Levi Jacobs, is woken in the night by his pregnant wife, with happy news their child is coming, but joy becomes tragedy as she dies in childbirth. Reeling from this loss, he vows to raise their daughter to be a strong hero, just like her mother, but even that fleeting comfort is stolen from the bittersweet moment as the poor infant struggles to breathe and dies in his arms!</p>

<p>Reeling at the loss, he staggers from one defeat to the next, slowly losing everything else he cares about.</p>

<p>Finally, after a particularly traumatic defeat at the hands of a new enemy, followed by a prolonged kidnapping involving the forced administration of narcotics to make him complaint, he lies in the infirmary of his ship, grief-stricken and struggling with addiction withdrawal. Just when he’s at an all-time low, he’s offered a ray of unusual hope, reminded that he once witnessed his future self travel through time.</p>

<p>Armed with this memory, he focuses to unlock the secrets of temporal magic, intent on undoing months of terrible events, only to find it’s not so easy, because he has to fight to gain the approval of the Moirai, better known as the Three Fates and speaking with them is no easy task.</p>

<p>Can Levi change history or will all that he loves remain forever lost in the past?</p>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>
</blockquote>

<p>The cover of the novel has multiple meanings:</p>

<p>First, a certain troll swordswoman is back, in the form of both a summoned ghost and an inadvertently summoned demon, one good, the other evil.  That's what the figures in the hourglass are about.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the good one is deeply concerned about the final destination of her soul, because the necromancer, Cha'da, summoned her away from the afterlife during her personal judgment day, just as her heart was being weighed against a feather.</p>

<p>Second, the protagonist, Levi, has a harrowing time trying to get back everything he's lost, using time travel.  The hourglass also serves as a reference to that.  This last of Levi's adventures reveals how he's judged by the Three Fates, all because he tried to change history without first asking permission.  In the end, he somehow has to balance the scales and justify his actions in order to change history.</p>

<p>Both character go through some very rough times along the way, but I find the ending of this one to be the most emotionally satisfying of the series.</p>

<p>I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I have.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8: Parting Ways</h2>

<p>Amelia lies in her bed, aching all over.  She's resting to heal, but her mind is quite busy.  She still has no option for cushioning wheels, but an alternative has occurred to her: an airship.</p>

<p>The only trouble with that is her best bet for lifting an airship into the air is 'metal phlogiston', which is better known in the modern world as hydrogen, but she's concerned about the explosive qualities of the gas.</p>

<p>After a knock at the door, Mrs. Maccle enters.  She expresses her concern for Amelia's health, but when Amelia tells her it's just bruises, her expression doesn't change.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maccle explains that Amelia has been accused of witchcraft.  The older woman also reveals that she's a witch, though even weaker than Amelia.  This admission earns the older woman even greater trust from Amelia.  As it turns out, the mayor's wife has been subtly guiding the locals toward greater tolerant, but this backfired with Amelia, because it was too much, too soon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maccle says she'll delay things as much as she can and her husband will investigate the accusation, but ultimately find Amelia and her sisters innocent, though they both know that won't be enough.  However, it will be plenty of time for the Blackwell family to pack up and leave, before a mob can take action.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maccle tells Amelia of a far off country to the west, beyond the ominously named mountain range known as 'The Burning Slopes', which is presumably volcanically active.</p>

<p>Dugaria, as the nation is named, is (in)famous for publicly accepting witches, though she knows nothing more about it.  The journey will take months if they cross the volcanic range or as much as a year, if they go around.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maccle wishes there was more she could do for them and Amelia smiles, because she's gotten an idea, suggesting the mayor's wife can help them some more by buying a bit more time.</p>

<p>In the next scene, Marta is on the roof of Amelia's warehouse/workshop, surreptitiously watching a mob that's gathered by the front door to protest the presence of an accused witch.</p>

<p>Marta heads back inside after reading their signs and hearing them shout about burning witches.  She joins Amelia, Iris, their Father and Mrs. Maccle in working on a crude airship that's little more than a big, flat platform with a railing and a building in the middle, though there's enough room for the family's vehicles at either end.</p>

<p>The whole thing is on wheels and has a steam engine that can drive it on the ground or run a pair of propellors.</p>

<p>They finish structurally reinforcing it and Amelia asks Mrs. Maccle to open the back doors.</p>

<p>The ship is rolled outside and Iris ties it off to prepared stakes, while Amelia gets the process of filling the gas bag started.  Marta and their father prepare to catch the bag as it unfolds, to avoid punctures, since they've only got one shot at this.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maccle heads off to join her husband, the sheriff and eight of his largest men on the other side of the building.</p>

<p>To serve as a distraction, the sheriff approaches the mob and demands to see their permit for the public gathering.  The conversation with the leader of the mob (a lawyer, by the way) implies they don't have one and as they go back and forth about the current situation, people from the mob begin sneaking away.</p>

<p>They argue the merits of whether Amelia is a witch or not, because "Oh my, she flew!"  The mayor tosses a paper airplane (they would probably call it a paper bird) through the air and makes a rather logical argument that what Amelia did was a scaled up version of the same.  He even insists there was no magic, just science.</p>

<p>There's more arguing as, in the background, the gas bag inflates and Amelia does some work on the control fins attached to it, though the mob is fortunately to distracted to notice.</p>

<p>Again, the matter of the permit is raised by the sheriff, including a threat to arrest everyone.  More of the crowd peels off, while the sheriff's men start circling the crowd.</p>

<p>The leader of the mob accuses the mayor and the sheriff of a conspiracy to help a witch (amusingly, this is quite true), but he makes the mistake of jabbing the sheriff with a finger.</p>

<p>She sheriff turns that finger into a serious point of pain and arrests the man for a variety of charges: assaulting an officer of the watch, disturbing the peace, incitement to riot and conspiracy to murder an innocent woman, a circumvention of justice.</p>

<p>The sheriff's men arrest what little remains of the mob.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the airship takes to the air, flying west.  The mayor asks his wife if she knows where they're headed.  She tells him they're going to Dugaria, where they hope they'll be accepted, and he groans.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maccle loses some confidence as she asks, "Witches are accepted in Dugaria, aren't they?"</p>

<p>Her husband's response is chilling: "Only because the government uses them as weapons!"</p>

<p>Sadly, Mrs. Maccle hadn't heard that part of the rumors.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it's far too late to warn the Blackwell family.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9: Burning Slopes</h2>

<p>Amelia's airship, <em>Airwitch</em>, has been in the air for about two and a half days and with Amelia at the helm at dawn, she finally spots The Burning Slopes, which live up to their name.</p>

<p>The mountain range is a line of volcanoes, which are currently not violently erupting, though lava pours down the sides of some.  I think of this similar to the volcanoes of Hawaii, which have been mildly active for generations.</p>

<p>Amelia is concerned about the danger of going over them in an airship that's lifted by explosive hydrogen gas, though the alternative of going around will take at least a month, if not longer, because they'll have to fight against the west-blowing prevailing wind they've been riding so far, if they turn.</p>

<p>They have a family meeting in which Amelia explains her concerns and calls for a vote.  She votes to go around the mountains.</p>

<p>Their father abstains from voting, to avoid a potential tie.  As a male born to a family of witches, Tim is quite used to letting the women in his life take charge.</p>

<p>Marta votes to go over, because their map shows no civilization anywhere nearby (too many volcanoes, which can be far more active on the moon of a gas giant, compared to Earth) and they only have a month's rations.</p>

<p>Iris agrees, because while they could theoretically forage for food, their mother trained them in a totally different kind of terrain than they've been flying over.</p>

<p>Amelia doesn't like the decision, but accepts it and pushes the engine to maximum power, because she wants to get over the volcanoes as fast as possible, even at the cost of wasting water.  She aims them between a pair of volcanoes that seem less active than the others, to maximize safety.</p>

<p>As <em>Airwitch</em> passes between a pair of volcanoes, one of them begins to erupt, but it's too late for Amelia to turn aside, lest she crash the airship into one of them!</p>

<p>Lava pours down the side and pools in the valley beneath <em>Airwitch</em>, producing a powerful updraft that carries them to a dangerous altitude that threatens to make the gas bag brittle enough to burst, because it's only cotton fabric coated and sealed with rubber.</p>

<p>Iris takes the helm, while Marta starts climbing a knotted rope to reach the top of the gas bag, where an emergency valve can be used to release some of the hydrogen, which would reduce their buoyancy.  Amelia heads inside, in preparation to refill the gas bag, once they're out of danger.</p>

<p>As it turns out, their father, Tim, hasn't been taking a turn at the helm, because he's scared of all the controls, too nervous to ever touch them.  Amelia has been taking his turns, despite the fact she has so much work to do on the ship.</p>

<p>Due to this fact, the system designed to re-compress the hydrogen for later reuse isn't done, forcing this crazy emergency procedure.  Thus, he feels responsible.</p>

<p>Tim punches Marta, leaving her lying on the deck with a dislocated jaw (Tim doesn't know his own strength and that was definitely unintended).  He climbs in her place and releases some of the hydrogen, while Iris shouts to direct him, though she thinks she's talking to Marta.  They lose most of their altitude, until they're just hundreds of feet above the treetops of a jungle.</p>

<p>During his climb back down, Iris and Amelia begin refilling the gas bag and the sudden change in acceleration causes Tim loses his grip on the rope!  As he falls to his death, he says a final prayer to the Gods for the safety of his daughters, feeling content his final act in life was saving their lives.</p>

<p>Amelia emerges from the interior, finding Marta lying on the deck, unable to speak. Amelia takes the place of Iris at the helm and Iris treats Marta's injury with a mixture of doctoring and a healing potion.  Naturally, putting Marta's jaw back in place produces a scream of agony.</p>

<p>Marta explains what happened and Amelia despairs, because she knows the fall wasn't survivable.</p>

<p>Iris runs to the back of the ship and looks the way they came, hoping to see her father, desperate for a chance to rescue him, but the volcano's eruption has gotten worse and the jungle is aflame.  It would not be safe to go back, forcing them to leave their father behind.</p>

<p>Iris collapses and sobs.  Marta scoops Iris up in her arms (remember, she's a big woman, built like a lumberjack) and carries her to the front of <em>Airwitch</em>, where the sisters mourn together.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10: The Welcome Village</h2>

<p>After a day's travel and almost 700 miles crossed, the sisters come to a small village and tether <em>Airwitch</em> to some trees, via a grappling hook.</p>

<p>The villagers stare up as Amelia looks down and one of them asks, "Are you a witch?"</p>

<p>She initially says "No, I'm an engineer!", but the man's wife says they like witches and when Amelia's sisters join her at the railing, they vote to be honest and Amelia admits they're witches.</p>

<p>The villagers were initially nervous about the airship, but the moment Amelia admits she's a witch, they go back to their business, as if women flying around in airships was normal.</p>

<p>They're invited to a lunch of fish and something akin to spinach in the tiny hovel that serves as the couple's home.  The man is named Davit and he's the village administrator.  He turns out to be very friendly and eager to convince the sisters to settle in the village, because they've been looking for a witch for years.</p>

<p>He shows them the house the villagers have built for their future witch and it turns out to be a rather wonderful home, a small mansion, in fact.  His people have been living as paupers, so they can afford to make some lucky witch exceptionally comfortable.</p>

<p>He claims the "humble home" is the best they can do, but it's larger than the one the sisters grew up in!</p>

<p>Amelia questions him about this and he claims the sisters are likely to find far better living arrangements in a larger city.</p>

<p>They ask why Davit's people would put themselves out for a witch like this and he explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"When a witch is needed, but there isn't one available, people suffer.  Witches heal and brew potions.  They help others, because that’s what witches do." Davit bowed his head, "With a witch in the village, we would prosper and know great peace.  Witches are a blessing from the Gods."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a few days to relax and mourn the loss of their father, Amelia and her sisters move on, intent on traveling Dugaria to find a good place to settle down (the village is nice, but too poor for their liking).</p>

<p>Davit gives them a map of the nation to help them on their way.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11: A New Home</h2>

<p>Six months later, Amelia wakes and walks the halls of the mansion she bought in Rimestar, the capitol of Dugaria.  Servants greet her in the halls and she has breakfast with her sisters, while waited on by their butler.</p>

<p>Amelia had no need for such a large house, but bought it for the 40 aches of fenced yard and the location, outside the city, though still within easy reach.</p>

<p>She also had no need for servants, but their salaries (aside from the gardeners) are paid for by the city, as an added incentive for witches to settle in the city.</p>

<p>Her sisters have been working in a local hospital, as doctors/healers.  There was a big accident and tending to the injured kept them up all night, so once they're done eating, they head off to bed, for some long-overdue sleep.</p>

<p>Amelia heads out to her workshop, which is on the land she bought.  She checks over the construction work taking place at one end.  The place is ready to be used, but not finished, since Amelia wants enough room to work on rockets intended to get her to orbit.</p>

<p>She briefly checks on her apprentices, who work on small devices intended for sale in the local market, then heads for the corner dedicated to her current project: <em>Blackbird II</em>.  The aircraft is nearly finished and the custom tires arrived the night before.</p>

<p>Vulcanized rubber is the big innovation of Dugaria, something Amelia has been studying, though she's not quite up to the level of the local craftsman that made the tires for her plane.</p>

<p>She cracks open the crate holding the tires and checks them over, quite pleased.  She begins working mount them.</p>

<p>Amelia is happy and content to be accepted and beloved by the locals.  She's also happy to have so many amazing resources available to her.  She reflects on the fact her sisters are also doing well, both of whom have been getting attention from men.</p>

<p>Amelia has also been catching the eye of hopeful young men, but she's always too lost in thought to notice.</p>

<p>However, despite how much Amelia loves Dugaria, she's been cautious about her greatest secrets, including runic enchantments, though that's is mostly a matter of her life-long habit of hiding her magic.</p>

<p>Amelia's work is interrupted by Hobard, the chief butler, who informs her that she and her sisters have guests that insisted on seeing all three of them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12: Assignments</h2>

<p>Amelia goes with Hobard and is led to the sitting room.</p>

<p>One of the couches is occupied by a woman in a dark green army uniform and a matching pointed hat, marking her as both a soldier and a witch.  Her collar bears a captain's insignia, with the addition of a little, pointed hat, because a witch always has greater authority than any non-witch of the same rank.</p>

<p>Seated opposite the woman are Iris and Marta, who were woken for the meeting.  Amelia sits between them.</p>

<p>The military witch introduces herself as Captain Scarth Denholm.  She goes on to tell them Dugaria is now at war.  By law and declaration of the King, all citizen witches have been conscripted into the army.</p>

<p>Iris objects, saying they've taken a vow of non-violence.</p>

<p>Amelia claims they never agreed to that and the Captain hands her a copy of the constitution of Dugaria.  Amelaia reads and learns that they automatically became citizens when they became home/land owners.  This is the reason Dugaria gives free homes and land to witches.  Amelia reads further, learning the King does have the right to conscript witches, whenever needed for the protection of Dugaria.</p>

<p>Marta demands to know what happens if they refuse, leading to a scene that speaks for itself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The military woman leaned forward and her hat produced a looming shadow over her face as her eyes glowed like those of a demon, a deep, red shade, like glowing blood, "<em>Do not</em> test me, ladies." Her icy tone was heavy with the promise of dangerous icebergs that could sink a ship, "I am the very best war witch this country has <em>ever</em> produced.  I would find it particularly easy to blow this entire house to splinters, followed by telekinetically dragging the three of you away." Her eyes stopped glowing and she leaned back in the couch, "However, that would be tedious," she glanced around herself, eyeing the fine furniture and the many paintings on the walls, "and an insult to the many witches that lived in this house before the three of you.</p>

<p>"Oh, and even if you think you might be able to overpower me with your combined magic, keep this little tidbit in mind: outside, the other six witches of my coven stand ready to support me and each of them is at least two-thirds as powerful as I am, all of them military trained for battle.  No little hedge witch could possibly win such a fight, and three would fare no better."</p>

<p>Amelia's eyes narrowed with anger, "So we're to be dogs of the military, whether we like it or not?"</p>

<p>The captain sighed, "Ladies, this isn't much different from the men of this country, many of whom are having a similar conversation, right now, though that's determined by random chance.  To make up for the fact that all witches are being conscripted, the King is offering commensurate rewards.  The pay is excellent and you'll have whatever materials you desire for personal magical research.  Just about anything can be within reach for a military witch.  We have but to ask, especially since we're going to war."</p>

<p>"But we have to be the King's magical assassins, right?" Iris glared, her voice filling with contempt.</p>

<p>"If that's where your talents lie." Captain Denholm stood and went on, "So, ladies, what will it be?  Do you come quietly, or do we brawl?" Again, her eyes glowed and she smiled, revealing a wild expression that hinted the woman was secretly hoping for a fight.</p>

<p>Waves of murderous intent carried by magic charged the air and the men behind her took a couple steps back.</p>

<p>Marta stood and hung her head, "It would seem we have no choice."</p>

<p>"What about our vow of non-violence?" Iris also stood, but remained slightly defiant.</p>

<p>Denholm shrugged, "Another casualty of war, I suppose, but you'll serve, either way.  Go quietly and you won’t have to wear chains."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the end, the sisters go quietly, because it's obvious they're no match for Captain Denholm.  She leads them to Fort Stand, a military post just outside the city, where their magical talents will be tested and they'll receive their assignments.</p>

<p>While the sisters are busy being tested, Captain Denholm returns to their property and Hobard is revealed to be a secret military spy, as are the rest of the house servants.</p>

<p>Hobard leads her to Amelia's airship, inside the workshop, and it's taken away, for study and to ensure the main characters don't fly away.  Little does Denholm know, the steam engines have all been removed to power the machines of the workshop (Denholm doesn't even know what a steam engine is) and the canisters of hydrogen have been emptied for the sake of safety, making it totally useless.</p>

<p>The sisters finish testing totally soaked in sweat, because they were pushed to their absolute limits.  They're lined up along with six other witches, to hear the results and receive assignments.</p>

<p>Marta's greatest magical talents lie in Fire and Earth magic.  Her assignment is to become a front-line Artillery Witch.</p>

<p>Iris has talents for long-range Sensory and Communication magic.  Her assignment can't be spoken publicly, implying she'll be doing something secretive, perhaps intelligence work.  The other witches glare at Iris with envy, because whatever her assignment will be, they think it's going to be a cushy one.</p>

<p>Amelia is declared to basically have no particular talent for magic and lacks power, a fact she already knew.</p>

<p>Denholm doesn't quite know what to do with her and asks, "What talents besides magic do you possess?"</p>

<p>Amelia answers honestly, by saying she's an engineer, a builder of machines, particularly vehicles, like her airship.</p>

<p>Denholm is shocked by this and briefly loses her composure.</p>

<p>They discuss her airship and Amelia points out the fact she used science to make it fly, rather than magic.</p>

<p>The Captain is quiet for a time, before she assigns Amelia to the basic physical training every War Witch receives, saying she'll have to discuss Amelia's final assignment with her superiors.</p>

<p>Amelia quietly makes up her mind to escape Dugaria, but since they're in the center of the country and will surely be watched, that will not be easy.  She hopes to distract people with technobabble and accomplish her true goals behind the backs of those watching her.</p>

<h2>Current Progress</h2>

<p><em>Starwitch</em> is about one-quarter finished, with the first three episodes of material in a rough draft state.  So far, I'm averaging about one episode a week.  I've written about 33,000 words, so far.</p>

<p>This piece will probably end up at 120,000 words or less.  Early chapters were heavy with descriptive detail and I was forced to write longer chapters (3,000+ words), due to how intricate everything Amelia builds is, but now that things are starting to move along with more action and slightly less science/engineering, the chapters are slimming down to my more typical average (2,000-2,500 words).</p>

<h2>Future Plans</h2>

<p>Episode four will begin with a five year skip forward, during which the sisters have been working for the army.  My intent with the episode is to produce a lot of character growth for the main characters.</p>

<p>Marta and Iris will get their own chapters dedicated to them, to show how much they've changed and how difficult their circumstances are.</p>

<p>Marta will be shown in the field, using her magic to destroy entire fortifications, while her conscience stings her for harming others with magic.</p>

<p>Iris will be seen using scrying magic (think CIA remote-viewing programs, only far more effective) to get instant results from distant battlefields, so her superiors can make better decisions.  I will probably end that chapter with Iris' superiors using her unit of black-ops witches to assassinate high-ranking officers of the enemy army, with extreme-range magic.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in her own chapter, Amelia will be seen squirreling away resources for a secret project, while Hobard tries very hard to find out what she's up to.  During the skip forward, she'll have been working as a government contractor, tasked with designing a horseless, armored "war wagon", a project Amelia has been delaying for years, intentionally detonating prototype after prototype, with the explanation that "steam engines are very hard to stabilize, a design flaw I hope to fix, soon."</p>

<p>The last chapter of the episode will bring them back together, because Amelia insists she needs her sisters on hand, claiming Iris is the best driver and Marta's magic is strong enough to control the blast if the prototype explodes.</p>

<p>They'll drive the new war wagon and go on the run across Amelia's land, toward a tower she's built, while Captain Denholm gives chase, via broomstick.  When they arrive, Marta will hold off the other War Witch, while Amelia and Iris blow one whole side off the tower, revealing the hidden shape of <em>Starwitch</em>, while the other half of the tower serves as the rocket's support gantry.</p>

<p>Marta will lose her fight with Denholm, but will have bought just enough time for her sisters to load the war wagon inside the base of the rocket and the three of them will blast off.  Denholm will probably try to follow, but she'll be unable to chase them out of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>After that, all future episodes will take place in space.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Chapter 3: Steam Without Flame</h2>

<p>Most of this chapter was descriptive details on Amelia's projects, to slowly demonstrate what she can do, despite her primitive surroundings.</p>

<p>Amelia is 14 in this chapter and now has a small shack to work in.  She pays for things by making and selling high-quality steel ingots to the village smith.</p>

<p>She's working on parts for a steam engine that lacks a firebox, a series of metal plates she's chiseling runes into, including the runes for 'metal', 'boil' and 'water'.</p>

<p>She finishes her work, assembles the plates with some rods to form something reminiscent of a heat sink, though with larger gaps between the plate.  She pours some water on it, which boils off as if the metal was hot, though it's cool to the touch.</p>

<p>I imagine the runes to be the written form of the language of magic, which just about anyone can use, though they need the right knowledge to make use of it: only runes marking metal and stone will work, because metal and stone act as mediums in which magic condenses.</p>

<p>Any previously living material, like wood or paper, will fail, because dead things strive to live again and use up the magic in that attempt.  Effectively, this means dead wood is very slightly zombie (maybe about 0.001%).</p>

<p>Marta (Amelia's oldest sister) joins her, curious to see what she's working on and they have a brief discussion of runes covering the above information.  It's stated that Marta's husband died around the time Amelia was four years old.  She's 12 years older than Amelia.  Marta is a rather large woman and built like a lumberjack, but she's not unattractive.</p>

<p>After they're done talking, Amelia puts the enchanted device inside the little engine's steam chamber and seals it.  She fills it with water and the belt wheel on the side spins, demonstrating that it works. Thus, Amelia is capable of making extremely compact steam engines with a level of power that rivals that of a modern gasoline engine.</p>

<p>Marta asks what's next and Amelia says she needs a carriage.  Marta is confused, because they don't even own a horse, but Amelia insists she needs only the carriage.</p>

<p>In the next scene, months have passed and Amelia has heavily modified a carriage into a horseless carriage and her sisters help her mount a heavy, magic-powered steam engine to the frame.</p>

<p>Amelia's Sister, Iris, is described.  She's a little taller than their mother, who's average height.  She's also exceptionally beautiful.  Her personal history is briefly illuminated as part of her description.</p>

<p>She'd been engaged to the mayor's son, but just days after they announced this to the whole village, he was murdered.  It isn't entirely clear how he died, though he was tied to a tree and wolves got him.  It isn't stated whether the wolves killed him or just ate him.</p>

<p>Iris has been very sad for the past three years, due to losing her betrothed.</p>

<p>With the work done, their mother gives them a picnic basket of food and the three of them head off for a test drive, with Iris in the driver's seat.  She turns out to be a crazy speed-demon and smiles for the first time in years.</p>

<p>Unknown to our main characters, the local smith and his son, both named Rolf Mossflaw (senior and junior, to be clear), were sneaking onto their land while they drove off.  The two of them witness the horseless carriage and Rolf senior concludes that it's witchcraft, despite multiple attempts to justify it as non-magical.</p>

<p>Eventually, the lack of smoke from the steam engine's firebox (it doesn't even have one, but he doesn't know that) forces him to accept the idea it's magic.</p>

<p>The smith and his son head back to the village, to "do the right thing" and tell the mayor, even though they don't want to.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4: A Terrible Choice</h2>

<p>Erika, Amelia's mother, is at home, working to prepare ingredients for potions, since healing potions are how the family made their money before Amelia started making steel.</p>

<p>Her husband, Tim, is a woodcutter, but it's a weekend and he's taken a day off to spend time with his wife, though he's fallen asleep in a rocking chair.</p>

<p>There's a heavy knock on the door, far too loud to be a social visit and Erika concludes the mayor is back to accuse her of being a witch, for the sixteenth time, even though it has been more than a decade since he last accused her.</p>

<p>The mayor once witnessed her using magic while he was drunk and has never let the subject go.</p>

<p>Tim wakes and offers to beat the man, but Erika decides another round of intellectual jousting will be enough to take care of the problem, so he sits down again.  In other words, she decides to handle it herself, since the mayor is an idiot and she normally runs mental circles around him.</p>

<p>She opens the door and Mayor Godfrey Rumblecleaver points the accusatory finger, saying, "She's a witch!  I've seen it with my own eyes!  This woman, Erika Blackwell, has had congress with the devil!  I saw her dance in the forest, naked, alongside a demon!"</p>

<p>He has an entire lynch mob with him, including his deputy.  The mayor is, by ignorant and stupid tradition (according to Erika's internal monologue) also sheriff and judge, though he's bound by law to follow certain procedures.</p>

<p>This involves giving the accused witch a chance to refute his claims.</p>

<p>As an avid reader, Amelia has both read and understood the village's entire law book, having committed it to memory, consequently making the mayor look like a fool once already.  She also taught her mother something: the law book says accusations require two or three witnesses.</p>

<p>Erika points this out, so the mayor provides another witness: the village moonshiner and local drunkard, who claims he saw Erika dance naked with a goat-horned demon!</p>

<p>Erika remembers the only occasion she saw him that week, in which he was drunk off his butt and likely hallucinating, so she isn't surprised he imagined her naked and a passing goat as a demon.</p>

<p>She asks the crowd to raise their hands if they believe the man to be a reliable witness when he's drunk, which is basically whenever he's awake.  No one raises a hand.</p>

<p>Likewise, she refutes the mayor's claim, because everyone knows how drunk he was the night in question, which was when Erika was 15.  She's now 42.</p>

<p>The incident took place during a harvest festival and moonshine had been freely available.  The young man that later became the mayor had been drinking heavily, despite the fact he'd never had any alcohol before.</p>

<p>The smith, Rolf, steps up next, reluctantly telling the tale of seeing Erika's daughters drive a bewitched carriage.  They argue for a time and he presents his irrefutable, expert opinion that it could only have been magically-powered.</p>

<p>Erika demands a second witness and Rolf junior confirms the story.</p>

<p>Seeing he's caught Erika in a situation she can't talk her way out of, the mayor offers a pair of awful alternatives: either Erika's daughters burn as witches, or she does in their place, because the law says a parent can pay for the crimes of a child.</p>

<p>He even goes on to call it a good bargain.  Meanwhile, his face is full of sick glee, because he's finally caught the witch he's chased most of his life.  If Erika agrees, then all she has to do is say out loud that she's a witch.</p>

<p>She says, "I'm a witch" so softly, no one but Tim hears and he rushes to attack the mayor, only to get shot in the shoulder with a crossbow bolt from the deputy.</p>

<p>Erika patches him up and he passes out.</p>

<p>Absolutely reveling in her torment, the mayor says he didn't hear her and she needs to speak up.</p>

<p>Erika speaks louder, but he still isn't satisfied, demanding that she speak loud enough for everyone to hear.</p>

<p>Finally, she shouts her true feelings to the world, including how proud she is to be a witch, making a verbal list of all the good things she's done for the villagers, much of it with secret magic.</p>

<p>She finishes by saying magic isn't evil, but the mayor is, having persecuted her over nothing, for decades.</p>

<p>As her hands are bound by the deputy, she considers torching her accusers with magic, but remembers her grandmother's words on the matter, which were basically, "Do no harm with magic."</p>

<p>She follows the vow of pacifism she made to her grandmother, going quietly to the pile of wood and the stake, to be tied to it, while moonshine is dumped all over the wood to make it burn better.</p>

<p>Before she's lit aflame, the mayor whispers to her, "I had to kill my own son, because one of your whore-of-the-devil daughters bewitched him, just like I did with that poor fool that married Marta!  I'm glad I finally get to see you burn for what you took from me!"</p>

<p>Finally seeing the depth of the man's depravity, Erika speaks her final words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She spoke at a volume comparable to a megaphone, her voice magically enhanced to ensure all ears present would take notice, "Know this day, Mayor Godfrey Rumblecleaver, that your sins will follow you to your very last day, while the gates of the infernal realm gape open and ready to take your soul!</p>

<p>"I declare to all: if any of you ever harms so much as one hair on the heads of my daughters, I <em>will</em> return as a vengeful spirit, with bloody intention to wipe out this entire village, guilty and innocent alike, <em>because evil triumphs when good men do nothing!</em>" Erika gave Rolf and his son a particularly scathing glare, before she looked once more at the now cowering mayor, to speak so softly only he should have heard her final words, though the magic still took them far and wide, "With my last, dying breath, I curse you to never know peace!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of that was just words to mess with everyone's heads, but who knows, maybe the last words of a witch have power beyond mere magic?</p>

<p>Erika uses magic to light the pyre herself, to take control out of his hands of the mob and steal from the mayor the option to believe he killed her.</p>

<p>Shortly after, her daughters arrive, just as a wagon full of men departs.  Marta is driving, barely managing to stop the carriage before succumbing to a numb and helpless silence, while Amelia sputters.</p>

<p>Iris, on the other hand, rushes to the aid of their mother, using magic to part the flame and loosen the ropes, so she can haul Erika free of the blaze, but it's all for naught, because she's already dead.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5: Salt in the Wound</h2>

<p>While Amelia's family are reeling at the loss of their wife/mother, a few days pass and the town crier shows up with a proclamation from the mayor: all property of the confessed witch is to be forfeit to the village and auctioned to pay for the firewood used.</p>

<p>The auction is scheduled for the next day at dawn, though they will have four full days to actually willingly give up the land or make arguments that they should be allowed to keep it.</p>

<p>Amelia's father produces a stack of old wills from her ancestors and she reads them all, discovering that every one of the Blackwell women for the past few centuries has used the same wording in their last will and testament.</p>

<p>The essence of it is that the home and land were given to a specific individual, but everything else became the collective property of their female progeny.</p>

<p>In essence, they foresaw the issue of being discovered as witches and had a strong legal defense in mind to dodge the seizure of property.  They would have done the same with the land and house, but local law forbids joint ownership of real estate, to prevent family arguments from spilling into court.</p>

<p>Amelia attends the auction and makes an attempt to buy their land back, but the mayor out-bids her, paying double the actual value of the land.  Amelia make herself publicly weep by thinking about her mother, but smiles on her way out of the courthouse, because the auction went just the way she planned.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, wagon loads of salt, alchemical waste and lye arrive at the Blackwell family home and their father directs the work of poisoning the land, to make it worthless to the mayor.  At night, the sisters use magic to summon rains storms, so the contamination will sink into the soil.</p>

<p>Their last day on the land, they pack up their belongings and Iris uses fire magic to burn the house's thatch, followed by Marta employing earth magic to make the mortar and stones of the walls crumble.  Last of all, Amelia jams the pressure relief valves of a small steam engine and activates it inside her workshop, before they all run away to avoid the explosion.</p>

<p>Effectively, there's nothing of value left behind.  They stay in a tent that night, but no one can sleep and their father goes out.</p>

<p>He visits the village smith and brow-beats the man into joining him.  They gather others that hate the mayor.</p>

<p>Together, the group throws a blanket over the mayor's head and haul him out of his house for the beating of his life, but before they get going, they tell him why, including among the accusation both everything they know and suspect.  He's warned that if he ever twists the law again, they'll come back to seek vengeance for the three people he's killed (Erika, his own son Conrad, and Marta's husband, Zayne).</p>

<p>In the morning, the mayor fails to show up for the deed to the Blackwell family's land and the subject of where their father went in the night is raised.  He admits nothing, but promises the man is still alive, followed by this little gem: "On those cold, winter nights, I imagine his knee will really ache and I hope he'll be reminded of all the bad things he’s done."</p>

<p>The sisters decide they can live with that and, in fact, it makes them feel slightly better.</p>

<p>They leave the deed to the land under a rock and depart for what they hope will be a land without persecution and prejudice.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6: The Stuff of Dreams</h2>

<p>After two years of off-and-on travel, Amelia and her family are near the city of Macclesfield, a prosperous farming community, where they've been camping long-term, to rest from their travels.</p>

<p>Amelia has built herself a horseless portable workshop in a wagon/shack similar to the one Mr. Pinewater lived in.  Inside, she's built herself a lathe that she's been using to make table legs, because no one in the city has ever seen the results of a lathe before.</p>

<p>Her table legs are all the rage in town with wealthy ladies, even though Amelia thinks the existing legs are better, but she's not going to argue with wealthy people giving her their money to do a job.</p>

<p>Amelia is depressed, because she wants a more permanent home and a much larger workshop, but most towns won't let them buy real estate, because they're outsiders.  Even worse, in the few towns that did, rumor reached all the way from the prejudice-filled village they left behind, causing them to flee for their lives, lest the Blackwell sisters be burned at the stake.</p>

<p>As she works on an order, Amelia reflects that she has wealth, but what she may actually need is influence, to change a few minds, that she might buy land, since she believes she's now beyond the reach of the rumors; it's been eight months since she last heard rumors about her family.</p>

<p>She finishes work and heads for town.</p>

<p>While she's there, she waives her fees in exchange for the the wives of the three members of the city council speaking to their husbands on her behalf, to make an exception to city law, so she can buy land.</p>

<p>It works and she even becomes friends with the mayor's wife, Mrs. Maccle, who has very forward-thinking views of women and thinks Amelia will be just the thing she needs to shake things up, in a good way.  It's never quite stated that way, but Mrs. Maccle is a feminist.</p>

<p>In the next scene, Amelia is shown a huge, disused warehouse, one option among many properties she might buy and she's soon seeing all the possibilities the place holds for her.  It even has an office area that could easily be converted into a comfortable home for her family, solving both issues.</p>

<p>She's soon lost in imaginary visions of what could be, eventually seeing in her mind not just the flying machines she been wanting to experiment with, but airships and eventually, a steel tower rising through the air on a column of super-heated steam!</p>

<p>The tower pierces the heavens and then turns at the apogee of it's flight, producing another burst of steam that carries if forward, until it's falling all the way around the world, always dropping, but never hitting ground, an orbit.</p>

<p>The word 'orbit' sticks in her mind, because she's never heard it before and she realizes the imaginary vision she just had wasn't her own.</p>

<p>She haggles over the price and buys the warehouse, before heading back to her little workshop, where she looks at <em>The Book of Newts</em> and asks, "What are you?"</p>

<p>The book flips of its own accord to the last page, which is blank.  Next, it flips to a page showing a diagram of the solar system.  Finally, it shows her star charts, and she finally realizes the sun the gas giant her little moon orbits is one star among many thousands of named stars, which are mapped in meticulous detail in the book.</p>

<p>She doesn't understand what it's telling her, but she feels exhausted, because the book has been manipulating the magic her body produces to flip it's pages, a feat that has left her with a headache, because her magic is rather weak.  It isn't able to finish what it was telling her, because she doesn't have the magic required for it to finish.</p>

<p>She recognizes the book has some kind of dream or desire, which mostly lines up with her own dreams, though it clearly thinks on a larger scale than she does.  She questions whether she should trust the book, since that was so very strange. It has never harmed her, so she decides to continue on her current path.</p>

<p>She also reasons that perhaps she owes it something for the knowledge shared, deciding to try and fulfill the book's dream of flying to the stars.</p>

<p>At this point, I finally named the gas giant Amelia's moon orbits: Junas.  Amelia believes it's the home of her world's gods, a much bigger world for giant, divine people.  By the way, it looks a lot like Jupiter, but let me make it clear: it isn't.  Junas is orbited by many worlds the size of Earth, plus lots of little ice moons.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7: Wings</h2>

<p>Amelia and her sisters work to haul her first full-size flying machine out of Macclesfield, while townsfolk look on, in wonder.</p>

<p><em>Blackbird</em>, as Amelia named it, is a fixed-wing aircraft with a single propellor, using another of her enchanted steam engines.  Amelia jokingly refers to the cockpit as a 'the witchpit', which is where the term was originally coined.  The aircraft is black and Amelia compares it to a raven.</p>

<p>It's winter and the ground is covered in snow, because Amelia hasn't yet learned about vulcanized rubber and didn't want to deal with metal or wood wheels at such high velocity, thinking the ride would be dangerously bumpy.</p>

<p>Marta drives the plane out into a farm field using another of Amelia's recent inventions, a steam-powered vehicle designed for heavy hauling, a tractor.</p>

<p>When they're ready, Amelia and Iris act as pilot and co-pilot, taking <em>Blackbird</em> into the air!  It's an exhilarating moment as they lift off the ground and Amelia cautiously gets them some altitude in a slow circle around the city, before turning control over to Iris, who does some crazy dives and sharp turns, until Amelia is sick.</p>

<p>Amelia takes them down for a landing, which is the part she's most nervous about, because she expects to crash the first time.</p>

<p>The landing goes smoothly, right up to the point they hit a boulder hidden by the snow!  Since everything is white, Amelia never saw it.</p>

<p>The prop smashes on it, then the engine hits it, producing a spray of hot water and steam, followed by the belly of <em>Blackbird</em> getting torn to shreds on it, while one of the skis is torn right off.  They're briefly forced back into the air, because the boulder somewhat acts like a ramp.</p>

<p>When they come back down, the left wing dips into the snow, due to the missing ski, lurching them to the side, until the wing rips off.  Next, the right wing does much the same, a whiplash-inducing sudden shift from twisting one direction to the other!</p>

<p>The wing also tears off, then the other ski breaks, leaving snow, ice and dirt spraying all over them through the torn bottom of the witchpit.</p>

<p>Amelia pukes, while Iris laughs hysterically and sobs at the same time.</p>

<p>Marta drives up to check on them, but fortunately, the only injuries they've got are lots of bruises and Amelia is motion sick.</p>

<p>There's some discussion of what went wrong and Amelia decides wheels are a must, after all, so she'll be seeking a way to cushion them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Needs must, when evil, dead witches drive…"</p>

<p>&nbsp; – Excerpt from Starwitch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="../books/starwitch/index.html">Starwitch</a> is a novel about space-faring witches that I plan to release first as a web series, then for sale in online stores.</p>

<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@OwenTyme/113483873966306253">You can read short summaries of each day's writing on Mastodon.</a></p>

<h2>About Starwitch</h2>

<p><em>Starwitch</em> is about three sisters that launch themselves into space with magic.  The novel has been named for their ship.  The setting will be primarily fantasy, though with some minor scientific elements, mostly in the form of mathematics, orbital dynamics and steam-powered machines.</p>

<p>I intend to publish this first as an episodic web series, then as a novel, so keep an eye on <a href="../books/starwitch/index.html">the webpage for Starwitch</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: Lonely</h2>

<p>The light sail ship, <em>Starwitch</em>, is sixty meters in length, with a tube-like hull similar to a rocket, though each side has aerodynamic lines that come to a peak and the tail includes control fins for atmospheric flight.</p>

<p>Out of those peaks, as well as the top and bottom, four masts can be extended and various types of spells can be strung between them for any purpose a witch could imagine.  Most often, they'll be used for a light sail that catches light to produce thrust from the solar wind of a star.</p>

<p>The side masts can also be extended and magically enhanced to function as wings during atmospheric flight.</p>

<p>Most of the interior is taken up by water tanks, both for drinking water and use as reaction mass for maneuvering thrusters, though the water can also be used as rocket propellant in combination with magic to heat it, since there's something akin to rocket nozzles at the back.</p>

<p>The entire ship is mechanical in nature, with the most complex non-magical device on board being a clock.  Everything else is based on enchantments or the magic of the witches that fly the ship.</p>

<p><em>Starwitch</em> has to be flown entirely manually, with a set of winches inside the 'witchpit' (cockpit) used to control the angle of the four masts.</p>

<p>As the story begins, the youngest of the sisters, Amelia, is alone and she's had only two hours sleep in three days.  She's hot on the heels of a far larger ship owned by the infamous pirate, the Dead Queen.  The other ship is a massive block of granite floating in space, which Amelia refers to as a monolith, since it's all one piece of rock.</p>

<p><em>Starwitch</em> was attacked by the monolith and the Dead Queen stole the enchanted mythril spell-core of <em>Starwitch</em> that allows even a weak witch like Amelia to perform high-intensity magic.  The Queen also kidnapped Amelia's sisters, to consume their magic and their souls, that she might extend her undead existence.</p>

<p>Amelia was intentionally left for dead, with just enough resources to follow the monolith, but not enough to reach safety, a sort of sport the Dead Queen has engaged in for centuries, just to see what a desperate and weak witch might do.</p>

<p>Amelia watches the monolith entering orbit of an icy moon, presumably to take on water for propellant, and she takes a somewhat different path, heading for a polar orbit.</p>

<p>She intends to meet the monolith on the other side of the moon, where she'll attack.</p>

<p>As she awaits her moment, which is days away, Amelia looks back on her memories with regret.  It all started so innocently, with a book...</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: The Book of Newts</h2>

<p>Amelia is ten years old and practically vibrates with excitement.  She's read every book available in the house and her mother has promised her that when Mr. Pinewater next visits, she'll get a book of her very own.</p>

<p>The old man comes to visit her family and in exchange for a healing potion from Amelia's mother, Mr. Pinewater allows Amelia to select a book from the collection he keeps in his wagon, which is basically a shack on wheels.</p>

<p>While the old guy digs for books on magic to entice her with, Amelia is asked to temporarily hold an old tome titled <em>The Book of Newts</em>.  Initially, it appears to be a book all about the water-dwelling amphibians, but for one brief instant, it shows its true nature to her.  The title is actually 'Newton's Mechanics'.  She blinks and it goes back to being <em>The Book of Newts</em>.</p>

<p>The old guy tries to get her to look at the books on magic, but Amelia decides she'd rather have a magical book, than a book about magic.  In fact, she insists, despite his every attempt to guide her to one of his books on magic, mimicking a very witchy tone of command her mother uses (Amelia's mother is also a witch).</p>

<p>She leaves the wagon/shack and the old guy drops his illusion.  He's still old, but no longer disheveled and his clothes become the fine, black robes of a wizard, while his hat turns pointy and black.</p>

<p>For a time, he worries he's done the wrong thing, because the book will raise Amelia to the stars, where a dangerous enemy lurks, but having seen the girl's insatiable thirst for knowledge, he decides it would be far more cruel to stifle the girl's potential, because he considers her a prodigy.  After all, she's already smarter than he is.</p>

<p>He's confident the child will succeed where he failed, though he's uncomfortable about the path he's set her on.</p>

<h2>Chapter 42: Pale Imitations</h2>

<p>This chapter opens with Lara entering the mine Wrath is using as his base on Earth.  She uses Mashu'ra's nose to smell out the situation, realizing all seven arch-demons are inside.</p>

<p>She asks, "You ready to go down in a blaze of glory, Masher?  I don’t think we’ll survive the day, but I’m game if you are."</p>

<p>Mashu'ra's response is straight to the point: "They took the boss.  She’s always been a key part of Vogerath’s plan to open a portal to Hell, because he can’t stabilize it without a half-demon.  So, this is bigger than us.  I’d sacrifice myself to save the world, any day of the week, because that’s what the boss would do."</p>

<p>With that confirmation of commitment, Lara heads deeper into the mine.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Insanity is happy to be free of the Hunter's head, with a physical body of her own.  She feels a little short on energy, but looks around at the seven arches, seeing the equivalent of a buffet.</p>

<p>As he backs away, Insanity screams, "I’m The Eighth Deadly Sin, Willful Insanity!  All of you demons are pale imitations of me, because people would have to be crazy to sin!  You have one chance to survive: bow down to me and pledge your eternal servitude or I’ll eat you all!"</p>

<p>Wrath is about to put the cursed wedding band made by Lust on Insanity's finger, but she points out the fact she's not in a binding circle.  Wrath looses his cool and real terror crosses his face!</p>

<p>One of the three bodies Pride showed up in changes form to a little garden snake and sneaks off, while Lust and Greed make their way toward the exit.  The other arches stand together, as a unified front, because they've all been challenged, though Sloth yawns.</p>

<p>Insanity considers Sogliun, the moon demon, to be the only real threat in the room, but he chickens out and flows downward, into the floor, while no one is looking.</p>

<p>Pride speaks for all: "We won’t serve you, but might be persuaded to allow you to join our ranks.  Though a few examples of the eighth arch demon have existed in the past, each was a dangerous, rogue element, definitely not a team player.  Will you be the same, or will you join us?"</p>

<p>Insanity's answer is to head-butt Wrath, while she impales both of Pride's bodies on her claws.  Wrath is hit so hard, his head goes rolling away.  Insanity eats both of Pride's bodies, somewhat refilling her energy reserves.</p>

<p>Still conscious, Wrath's head rolls to a stop near the third copy of Pride.</p>

<p>Wrath asks for help and Pride eats him, which was according to Pride's plan, all along, because he intends to eat all of the arches and then eat their boss, the Void.</p>

<p>Alice looks on as Insanity deals with the arches, bothered by the fact that the Hunter seems to be dying.  After some magical analysis, she realizes the Hunter is missing human genetics that she requires to survive on her own and with the demon separated from her mind and body, she can't gather the magic she'd been using to sustain herself.</p>

<p>Alice clasps the Hunter's forearm and begins feeding her magic, though it's only a stop-gap measure, that will buy half an hour.</p>

<p>Envy tries to escape, but Insanity crushes her to death with the thrown corpse of Wrath.</p>

<p>Gluttony is scared, rightly afraid she's about to be eaten, while her bodyguards abandon her, aside from one.</p>

<p>Her last bodyguard turns out to be a regular fairy that's been bound to serve Gluttony by some bargain the two of them made.  He takes the form of a humanoid turtle made of diamond.  Gluttony is smashed with the body of her last bodyguard, thrown like a projectile.  I just wanted to do a little foreshadowing for a later book.</p>

<p>Insanity turns her attention on Lust and Greed.  There's a brief argument and Insanity decides to slay Lust, but can't, stopping a fraction of an inch from the kill.  She tries again, but same results.</p>

<p>Lust reiterates the bargain she made with the Hunter in the previous book: She must protect Lust and Lust will answer any question the Hunter asks.  Insanity was part of the Hunter at the time, so she's bound by the agreement.</p>

<p>Insanity screams in her face, "There’s nothing I want to ask!"</p>

<p>Insanity kills Greed and his guards, then grabs Lust.  She warns the arch-demon that she'll keep her 'safe' and 'alive', but that Lust may not like her definition of those words, if she presses her luck.</p>

<p>Turning to Sloth, Insanity asks, "What about you, Sticky?"  I like this little nickname, because Sloth is a living goo monster.</p>

<p>Sloth just wants to go home, without a fight.</p>

<p>Insanity punches him, splattering him all over the walls.</p>

<p>She thinks he's dead and turns away, but he speaks again, "It isn’t that easy."</p>

<p>Sloth tries sleep magic, because he's famed for it, and everyone present falls asleep, except himself and Insanity, because "Madness never sleeps."</p>

<p>She tries to swallow Sloth whole, but Sloth explodes into mist.  She thinks it's a self-destruct spell designed to prevent him from being eaten, but Sloth was never truly there.  He only showed up by dream-walking, more or less a variation of astral projection.</p>

<p>Insanity looks on Alice and the Hunter and decides to eat them, since with the Hunter out of her head, she no longer has any sense of fair play.</p>

<p>Alice wakes in time to see the gaping maw of Insanity and has just enough time to manifest the torn mushroom cap that allows her to grow larger, cramming the whole thing in her mouth!</p>

<p>At the same time, Lara arrives, just in time to see, but not understand the resulting explosion, as Alice grows so fast, she smashes her way through the roof of the cave!</p>

<h2>Chapter 43: Remorse of Conscience</h2>

<p>Alice's transformation leaves her standing in a hole in the ceiling, as the light of dawn filters through her dress, bathing the room in blue light.  Each of her feet (in boots, of course) is six feet long!</p>

<p>During the collapse cause by Alice's actions, Insanity rushed to the side of Lust, to deflect falling boulders.</p>

<p>Alice bellows, "How dare you try to kill our sister?"</p>

<p>Alice steps back (the ground shakes as she walks) and peers down into the hole.  She reaches to pick up the Hunter, to keep her safe, but Insanity screams, "She's mine!"</p>

<p>Insanity attack's Alice's hand with her claws and Alice tries to punch her, much the way a human might try to smash a mouse!  Insanity flops on her back and accepts the strick, so she can use all four sets of claws, latching onto Alice's hand!</p>

<p>Alice hauls her hand back out of the hole, taking Insanity away, though she stumbles off, causing another quake.</p>

<p>Lara drops her invisibility spell and rushes to the Hunter's side, asking what happened.</p>

<p>Lust actually takes responsibility, actually in tears over the guilt she feels.  She even apologizes.</p>

<p>Lust explains everything, including why she did it (revenge), but now she feels awful about it.</p>

<p>Lara turns her into a Tommy gun and points it right in Lust's face, to demand, "Give me one good reason I shouldn't kill you right here and now!"</p>

<p>Lust explains what needs to happen to reintegrate the Hunter: her three personalities need to willingly merge.  Alternatively, the giant can eat Insanity, then merge.</p>

<p>Lust begins to feel remorse for every single wrong thing she's ever done, which isn't a short list, with sins darker and more bloody than the worst serial killer, because her conscience is finally working properly, as a result of her recent religious reading habits.</p>

<p>Lara decides to let Lust live, but only of she signs an unconditional contract to answer Lara's questions.  Lara hands over a sheet of paper and Lust writes, 'I promise to answer the questions of Lara Simmons.'  She bites her thumb and stamps the page with her bloody fingerprint, sealing the bargain.</p>

<p>The Hunter calls attention to herself, because she's a hair away from death, so Lara uses a little magic to transfer Mashu'ra into the girl's body.  Mashu'ra gets her back on her feet and in fighting form, at the cost of great pain, but the Hunter reasons a little pain is a small price to pay to save the world.</p>

<p>After all, with Insanity running loose, every human in the world is in danger.</p>

<p>Lara returns her hat and asks, "You ready to rock and roll?"</p>

<p>The Hunter nods, so Lara turns into an M1911 pistol, which the Hunter catches out of the air.</p>

<p>She steps over to Lust and points it right in her face.  For a tense moment, Lust believes she's about to die, based on the idea of the Hunter pointing the gun as a mere threat, while the imp (Mashu'ra) pulls the trigger.  She closes her eyes and accepts her fate.</p>

<p>The Hunter fires, putting a bullet through Lust's ear, because she's beyond pissed.  Lust opens her eyes just in time to be pistol-whipped!</p>

<p>Lara orders her to stay put and threatens a fate worse than death if she isn't there when they come back, claiming she just put a tracking curse on Lust, with that bullet.</p>

<p>The Hunter screams in Lust's face, then flies out of the hole in the ceiling.</p>

<h2>Chapter 44: Rock and Roll</h2>

<p>Alice struggles with Insanity, discovering her giant size has some serious disadvantages: it slows her regenerative powers and makes her a big target, despite giving her incredible strength.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Insanity winds her way up and around Alice's arm, cutting her all the way to the bone!  Alice tries to scrape her off, but Insanity dodges.</p>

<p>Getting desperate, Alice calls DRINK ME into her hand and downs the entire bottle!  She explosively shrinks down to the size of an ant and brags hold of Insanity's fur, with the intent of reaching the ear, where such a tiny figure might do some serious damage.</p>

<p>The Hunter flies into the air, seeing Insanity fall as Alice vanishes.</p>

<p>Lara turns into a Barret M107 anti-material rifle and the Hunter puts a round through Insanity's head, causing it to explode!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Alice has reached the spot between Insanity's shoulder blades, where she decided to take a short breather.  She's really grateful she took the breather, because otherwise, she might have been hit.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Insanity is beyond the power of the average demon and manages to regenerate her head, a feat no other demon can match!</p>

<p>Alice continues her climb.</p>

<p>Knowing the situation is too hot for Lara, who might easily be killed in the mayhem, the Hunter leaves her behind and charges into battle.</p>

<p>Lara is upset by this, but decides to find a hiding place, so she can still contribute, by sniping.</p>

<p>The Hunter and Insanity roll through the Outback like a pair of angry, giant cats, but while the hunter gets stronger the more damage she takes, she also gets more stupid, the same issue Simmons always dealt with in cat-man form!</p>

<p>She lets go and kicks Insanity away, so she can think.  She concludes brute strength is not the answer and none of her armored forms would work, either.</p>

<p>She wants to try grenades, but realizes she can't reach any of her gear inside her hat, without her demon powers.</p>

<p>She's also somewhat worried her mother's magic isn't protecting her, but her mother's power was split three ways and she's become ineffectual as a result.</p>

<p>She has Wood, Water, Air and Fire magic, so she combines the first three to rapidly grow trees to snare Insanity in a web of wood.  Insanity is so strong, however, that she immediately starts to break free, so the Hunter adds some Fire magic, using the wood for fuel, while she produces pure oxygen with Air magic!  The flame gets so hot, it burns blue!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Alice is in Insanity's ear and worries she's about to be burned to death.  She magically produces the mushroom cap and eats the whole thing in one bite!</p>

<p>Alice violently explodes out of Insanity's head, then starts punching the demon with her full, gigantic strength!</p>

<p>Insanity produces a painful telepathic scream of rage that sends Alice stumbling away, before she falls to the ground, causing an earthquake!  Likewise, the Hunter is stunned, while Insanity gets back to her feet!</p>

<p>Lara opens fire, once again exploding the demon's head!</p>

<p>We switch to the perspective of Lust, who's guilt in this matter stirs her to action, because she can sense our heroes are losing the fight.</p>

<p>She feels she must help, so she flies out to join them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lara empties her magazine, repeatedly blowing Insanity's head off, though she grows back faster each time.  On the other hand, Lara has always laced her rounds with either poison or disease and Insanity does slow down a bit.</p>

<p>Once Lara's all out of ammunition (it takes her a while to magically produce .50-cal rounds, since they're so large), Insanity picks up the Hunter, in preparation to eat her, once and for all.</p>

<p>Lust arrives and pours on every bit of charm magic she can, slowing Insanity down with multiple tempting offers that match Lust's nature.  Her words make Alice and the Hunter both blush.</p>

<p>While Insanity is distracted, the Metal Spirit, which killed Simmons, shows up and whispers to the Hunter.  As usual, it does so in poetic rhymes of four lines.</p>

<p>It uses flowery words to apologize for killing Simmons, then explains its nature as having been forged from earth using fire, air and water, hinting that it's a child of all four of the basic elements.  The rhyme also implies that humanity made it what it is.  I like this as an explanation for why it's so strong, probably the most powerful elemental spirit, aside from Life and the Void.</p>

<p>Therefore, it decides to serve the Hunter willingly, that she might save humanity.</p>

<p>There's a brief scene inside the Hunter's head, in which it bows to her, offers up a token (a cast-iron and steel bracelet) and the Hunter collars it, much like she did with the Water and Air spirits in previous books.</p>

<p>Coming back to the real world, Insanity once more picks up the Hunter, then opens her mouth extra wide, to eat her.  The Hunter hears Vogerath/Pride screaming, amused by the sound.</p>

<p>The chapter comes to a close as the Hunter focuses her mind to use Metal magic for the first time, while the bracelet tinkles on her wrist, since those tokens are both metaphors and real objects.</p>

<h2>Chapter 45: (Re)forging Bonds</h2>

<p>Insanity snaps her jaws shut on the Hunter, only to break some of her teeth!  Letting go and stepping back, she sees the Hunter's clothes have produced metal plates, just like a suit of armor!</p>

<p>This metal-shrouded transformation is much like the iron wood armor she got from subjugating the Jungle Spirit, but instead of some rather heavy wood, the metal spirit has given her armor plates composed of layered titanium and tungsten, producing something with properties of both.</p>

<p>Insanity throws a temper tantrum, slamming her fists into the ground, producing brief earthquakes!</p>

<p>In the background, Alice drinks her potion, returning to normal size, mostly so she can heal.</p>

<p>The Hunter looks Insanity in the eye and raises a hand, then pretends with the other she's turning a crack attached to the first, seemingly resulting in her middle finger popping up.</p>

<p>Insanity is actually amused, saying, "I like that gesture.  It fits the Robocop thing you've got going."</p>

<p>But having seen her greatest desire frustrated, Insanity is done with the fight and decides to walk away, though she promises to return to eat the Hunter, followed by every one of her sheep (meaning the human race).  She plans to force the Hunter to watch as she wipes out everyone.</p>

<p>The Hunter screams at her, but Insanity ignores her.</p>

<p>Working with Mashu'ra, the Hunter produces a wall of fire to block Insanity's way, which curves around all three of them, in a huge circle.</p>

<p>Insanity turns back to point out the futility of continuing to fight, while the symbols required to bind a demon begin appearing in the flames, thanks to Mashu'ra, while seven more fiery binding circles forming.</p>

<p>When the first circle closes, Mashu'ra is significantly weakened, but the Hunter picks up the slack and maintains the magic long enough for Mashu'ra to finish shaping all the binding symbols.  He falls unconscious and ends up on her shoulder.</p>

<p>Having lost Mashu'ra's power, the Hunter collapses, but gives the demon double middle fingers, before she falls over.</p>

<p>Insanity screams and charges, but runs out of power before she reaches the Hunter, because her demonic powers have been sealed.  She scrabbles to get closer, but lacks the strength to move and throws another temper-tantrum, demonstrating how immature she is, without the Hunter.</p>

<p>She's horribly upset and complaining about how 'unfair' the situation is.</p>

<p>Aliget gets up, bites into her mushroom cap and grows back to giant size.  She picks up the helpless demon and eats her, though she does say something soothing, to try and make Insanity feel slightly better about it.</p>

<p>Alice takes a swig of DRINK ME and returns to normal size.  She lays down next to the Hunter and asks, "Can we be friends?"</p>

<p>As far as the Hunter is concerned, they already are, and even better, they're sisters, so she nods agreement.</p>

<p>Alice vanishes, re-absorbed by the Hunter.</p>

<p>The Hunter puts Mashu'ra in her hat.</p>

<p>The hunter enters her mindscape, finding Alice has made a little corner of it her own, with a small patch of gigantic grass, a tiny little sun for some light and a huge mushroom, on which Alice sits.  Beside that are a record player producing psychedelic rock and a little apple tree with grenades instead of apples.</p>

<p>Alice is smoking form the Caterpillar's hookah, while the Caterpillar has been put in a specialized straight-jacket designed to keep it's very many arms under control.  It's mouth is gagged, but it soon gets that loose and growls in the voice of Insanity.</p>

<p>“Quit harshing my buzz and relax for once!” Alice complains and shoves the stem of the hookah in the demon’s mouth.</p>

<p>Insanity inhales, but doesn't like it, spitting it out, before another torrent of complaints come form the Caterpillar's mouth.</p>

<p>The response of Alice is to slap Insanity, followed by telling her to shut up.</p>

<p>The Hunter falls over laughing, because this is something hilarious she never expected to see!</p>

<p>Lara finds the Hunter rolling in the dirt, laughing until she cries.  Concerned, she calls the Hunter by name, calling her Artemis.</p>

<p>She stops laughing and considers that name, which was given by Simmons.  She still sad she's lost him, but she's ready to accept that name as part of moving forward.  From this point on, she starts referring to herself as Artemis.</p>

<p>Lara helps her up and together, they seek out Lust, finding her stuck in the dirt, unable to free herself, because she hit the ground that hard, when Insanity backhanded her.</p>

<p>They help her out and Lara thinks her for helping. Lust doesn't accept her gratitude, because she doesn't feel she deserves it and apologizes to Artemis for everything she's done wrong.</p>

<p>Lara asks Artemis if she can handle transportation and she puts Lust in her hat.  Lara turns into a pistol, for ease of carrying, and Artemis vanishes into a puff of smoke.</p>

<h2>Chapter 46: Hemming the Fray</h2>

<p>Artemis reappears far above <em>The Cauldron of the Elements</em> (Macie's home valley).</p>

<p>She enjoys the view as she falls, in Australia, dawn was just over, but here, dusk is about to begin.</p>

<p>And yes, that does finally pin down the timezone of the place, likely putting it somewhere in the Appalachian mountain range, but I'm not going any further than that.  It's a fictional place, so don't go looking for it.  And now that I've started a conspiracy theory, let's get back to the story.</p>

<p>From above, it looks desolate and dead, because the interior is masked by an illusion spell, to keep it safe.  Artemis passes through this, revealing the forest and blue lake.</p>

<p>She takes control of her fall and flies down to Macie's house, where she knocks on the door, then flies out of sight three times, messing with Macie's head as she answers.</p>

<p>Lara ends the game by speaking and Macie invites them in.</p>

<p>Hours later, James and Lara have fallen asleep on the couch, leaving a lovely scene of mother and son.</p>

<p>Artemis and Macie sneak out quietly, to avoid waking them, and head for the old amphitheater and stage.  There, Macie begins teaching Artemis to dance and juggle, which are both important components of <em>The Dance of Fire and Autumn</em>.</p>

<p>Decades earlier, when Artemis met the Fire Spirit, it promised to willingly serve her, if she could subjugate the Metal Spirit, then summon the Fire Spirit via the dance.  Having gotten the Metal Spirit under control, thanks to Simmons, she now wishes to summon the Fire Spirit, because she's convinced it will be useful in combat.</p>

<p>Artemis has trouble with dancing, tripping over her own feet, but picks up juggling fairly quickly.</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>Lust is back in a cell, reflecting on how much she's changed and how far she has to go.  Lara and Verda just finished an interrogation session, which Lust fully cooperated with.</p>

<p>Cooperation has led to improvements in Lust's living arrangements, including a soft bed and a chair for her to relax in, as well as more choice in food selection, but Lust doesn't think she deserves any of it.</p>

<p>Each such session leaves her wanting to die, because she's wracked with guilt for her many, many dark deeds, but she staves off such thoughts by reading The Book of Mormon.</p>

<p>After reading for a time, she prays.  She isn't certain if God is real or not, but knows that praying certainly makes her feel better.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure where I'm going with Lust's journey, but I'm planning to span it over the course of several more novels.  However, part of it is clear: Lust's journey to redemption demonstrates the fact that the "demons" aren't actually what they claim to be, further emphasizing the fact they're dark fairies, because they can change.</p>

<p>Switching to Artemis, we find her putting James in his crib after a meal and some cartoons, because he fell asleep on the couch and she's been babysitting for Lara.</p>

<p>Lara and Verda enter the apartment.  Lara starts a meal, while Verda sits on the couch and Artemis sit opposite her, in a chair.  They acknowledge each other, before Verda falls asleep on the couch.</p>

<p>After all, with both Lara and Artemis in the place, who have both defeated Wrath, Verda feels totally safe and can sleep peacefully.  It isn't a permanent solution to her post-traumatic stress, but quality rest is required for proper mental healing.</p>

<p>Artemis reflects on the fact they had been grieving the loss of Simmons separately, but ironically, Wrath somehow managed to bring them together.</p>

<p>She also reflects on the valuable lesson Evie and Simmons taught her: Artemis will always value the time she has with her friends, short though it may be.  However, she will never stop fighting to keep them safe.</p>

<h2>The Editing Process</h2>

<p>With the Epilogue finished, I've completed the rough draft of <a href="../books.html#she-seeks-peace">She Seeks Peace</a>.</p>

<p>This work-in-progress log will pause until I begin a new project, so I can do a pass of editing on <em>She Seeks Peace</em>.  With the way I've been using text to speech software for my daily editing, I've been finding my typos and spelling mistakes earlier on, so I'm likely to only do one editing pass, mostly a matter of looking at the plot.  I'll do more when it comes time to publish, but I'm eager to get to my next project.</p>

<p>I'm likely to add some scenes in which the Metal Spirit comes to Artemis/the Hunter, looking to apologize, because its appearance at the end was a bit abrupt.  That will give me the opportunity to add a couple of funny places our heroine can seek peace.</p>

<p>One of the scenes I had in mind, but never used, was to have her hide among a herd of black and white cows.  Her magic clothes will give her camouflage, to fit in with them.  My thinking is there will be lots of metal fencing near the cows, justifying the presence of the Metal Spirit.</p>

<p>I think I need to come up with two more little scenes like that, just to subtly introduce the idea of it's presence for the final fight, though I need to be careful about when and where I insert them.  I think they would work best early on in the novel.</p>

<p>I mentally justify its presence in Australia with the fact the final battle took place near an old, abandoned mine (it wasn't quite as played-out as the owner thought), on top of the fact Australia exports a lot of mined metals.  Perhaps I need to throw another four line block into its rhymes, to serve as a sort of explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Metal, Metal everywhere,<br/>
Under feet, here and there.<br/>
Metal made from Metal ore,<br/>
Man ever digs, such a chore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would also fit with previous appearances, because it usually makes reference to metal Artemis didn't realize was present.</p>

<p>Other than that, the only other thing I'll need to do is add some descriptive details, which I always do during editing.</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>

<p>There's two possibilities looming for my next project, the first a short story, the other a novel.</p>

<h3>The Recruit (Working Title)</h3>

<p><em>The Recruit</em> will be a short story centering around Detective Shime Yasu, who readers may recall from <a href="../books/ashen-blades/demon-for-president.html">Demon for President!</a></p>

<p>You might remember that she was given a special card to use, which had a number for her to call when she's "ready to open her eyes".  The story will begin with Yasuy lying awake, unable to sleep, because her mind is too busy with the bizarre things she saw in the body cam videos of Ulmoch and Artemis in action.</p>

<p>She'll call the number and the story will show a glimpse into the recruiting and training process for the Order of Ash and Smoke.  Artemis, Lara and Verda will work together for training.</p>

<p>Yasu will be one among many local recruits, but the story will center around disabusing the group of all misconceptions about demons, because all of them brought weapons they thought would be effective, including crosses, holy water and some dumb fool got confused, so he brought a wooden stake.</p>

<p>It will be a simple story, in which Artemis captures a demon for training purposes, while Lara tests all of the things the recruits brought, once more hammering home the point that they're not actually demons, because the crosses do nothing, the holy water just gets him wet and hammering the stake into his heart just gets him to make creepy comments (Ulmoch has always been a masochist, so he enjoys people hurting him).</p>

<p>Finally, Yasu will ask, "So, what does work?"</p>

<p>Lara will transform into an M1911 and Artemis will shoot Ulmoch in the head, while Lara delivers the punchline: ".45 rounds are good."</p>

<p>Yep, the whole story is just setup for a joke, though I think ending it with Yasu sleeping soundly would be a nice touch.</p>

<p>I've had this story in mind since I wrote the bits involving Detective Yasu, but had to get past <em>She Seeks Peace</em> to know the mental state of my characters, since the ending of <a href="../books/ashen-blades/demon-for-president.html">Demon for President!</a> was a big, dangling plot thread.</p>

<h3>Star Witch</h3>

<p>The other project I'm eager to get to is tentatively titled <em>Star Witch</em>.  This will be about a trio of witches and sisters that used magic to launch themselves into space.</p>

<p>The story will focus on one of the sisters, who's named Amelia.  She's the enchanter and engineer that built the light-sail ship, named <em>Star Witch</em>, but lacks talent for other forms of magic, barely able to operate the ship on her own power.</p>

<p>Most of the details are foggy to me, but I know it begins with Amelia alone aboard <em>Star Witch</em>, aside from the house brownies that serve as the ship's repair crew, though she's never seen them.</p>

<p>Amelia is extremely exhausted at this point, because she's been operating the ship around the clock with minimal breaks for sleep, when it was designed to be operated in shifts or left to its own devices for long periods of time.</p>

<p>Amelia's sisters were kidnapped several days earlier and <em>Star Witch</em> was left badly damaged, all by order of the villain, the Dead Queen.</p>

<p>Amelia has been following the Dead Queen's monolith (a huge, granite slab with tunnels cut through it, which serves as her star ship), using the bigger ship's wake of waste magic to barely keep her own light sails functional.</p>

<p>My plan is to do a series of flashbacks on the lives of the three sisters building and launching <em>Star Witch</em>, followed by docking at a space station, where they'll hear tales of the Dead Queen, a powerful witch that drains the life and magic from other witches, to extend her own life.</p>

<p>Eventually, the story will culminate in the monolith moving into parking orbit above an icy moon in the present (they've stopped to take on water, which is required for various processes aboard the big ship, despite the crew being undead), while Amelia goes around the moon the other way.</p>

<p>Amelia's intent is to surprise the monolith from the front, rather than attacking from behind, the last thing the Dead Queen might expect.  Amelia has no other choice: she's dead without either the stolen mythril core of her ship or the backup of her sisters; she's the weakest of the three witches, barely able to get <em>Star Witch</em> moving on her own.</p>

<p>The truth is, the Dead Queen setup the entire situation for the sake of entertainment, a sort of sport she's played with smaller ships for centuries.  She takes the strongest witches to extend her life and leaves the very weakest with a barely functional vessel, eager to learn what a desperate witch might do.</p>

<p>However, she didn't know and didn't count on <em>Star Witch</em> being full of house brownies, which can repair the ship, even in the absence of proper supplies, nor did she count on Amelia's exceptional skill with mathematics and engineering, which will be the lesser witch's greatest weapons.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure how Amelia will get her sisters back, but I do know she'll intentionally crash <em>Star Witch</em> into the monolith, so she can board the pirate vessel.  This might involve crashing into a docking bay, but thinking about it, the bridge would be far more fun, a combination of destroying command and control functionality, followed by a desperate rescue mission, while the house brownies hold the line against the Dead Queen's soldiers.</p>

<p>I'm going to use Amelia's lonely tale as a framing story for the novel, to add tension and foreshadowing for the climax, coming back to it at the start and close of each part of the novel.</p>

<p><a href="https://books2read.com/DemonForPresident"><img src="../images/Flyer-DemonForPresident.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p>Today, November 5, 2024, is a very special and strange day, at least in the United States, where I live.  The current election and division between the Republicans and Democrats really inspired me to pay attention during the first republican debate, last year.</p>

<p>I've never voted, since politics has always literally given me a splitting headache, because there's too many lies to really uncover the truth.  Cynically, I sometimes wonder if there's any truth to be found, at all.</p>

<p>Still, I wasn't paying attention to the politics, but rather to the behavior of political candidates, because I'd had a bizarre, fun and timely idea for a novel: what would happen if a demon ran for President of the United States?</p>

<p>So, I watched and continually found material that could be twisted into political satire, all the while unsure if I had the skill to make the novel work.  I got it published in June, just in time for the current election to really heat up.</p>

<p>With voting happening today, I've been thinking about that novel, which is titled <a href="../books/ashen-blades/demon-for-president.html">Demon for President!</a></p>

<p>I ran the election and potential twists through my head many times during the writing process, but never did I expect so many parallels between fiction and the real world.</p>

<p>In my novel, the demonic villain, Otto Vogerath, was shot at by a sniper while cutting the ribbon for a store.  On July 13, Former President Trump became the target of a sniper, an event that chilled me to the bone, because reality became eerily like something I'd written.</p>

<p>For another example, I wrote about the President bowing out of the election to make way for another candidate, so it really caught my attention when that happened!</p>

<p>There are other parallels, but none so shocking as those two, or which I would care to discuss, because I'm not here to draw connections between real people and fictional characters that really aren't connected.</p>

<p>I wrote the novel early this year and published it in June, <em>before</em> these events took place, but all I can think is this: art imitates life and life imitates art.  There is truth to that old adage, after all.</p>

<p>I found the experience of writing political satire to be fun, educational and even intellectually stimulating, but at the same time, it made me nervous to see my fiction come true in such unsettling ways.  I can't say I found that part of the experience enjoyable, which may be why I haven't discussed this novel as much as others.</p>

<p>I meant it all in fun, as a way to point out how silly and funny politicians can be, but I think I cut this piece too close to reality.  It surprises me, the things I see without comprehending, which can so easily become a part of my work.</p>

<p>So much of my writing process is a subconscious black box, which I don't even pretend to understand, a gift that must be fed for me to retain it, but which sometimes produces things that leave me speechless for the most unusual reasons.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I can take any more parallels with my novel, but hopefully, our next president won't open a portal to Hell, so endless legions of demons can march forth to conquer the Earth.  That would be one bit of straw too many for this particular camel.</p>

<p>Still, once the dust of this election clears, why not read about what could have been, if we'd gotten a <a href="../books/ashen-blades/demon-for-president.html">Demon for President?</a></p>

<h2>Chapter 38: Letting Go</h2>

<p>Evie spends all morning and afternoon speaking with the spirits of her dead friends.  It gets pretty emotional for her, because she's doing her best to let them go, so they can pass on.</p>

<p>The Hunter holds her hand and Evie squeezes it pretty hard with each tearful goodbye.  She grows a little older with each, until she's about thirty years old.</p>

<p>Last of all, she talks with her grandmother, but Evelyn asks to speak with the Hunter and Evie makes her visible.</p>

<p>Evelyn explains that she watched the world with magic for a very long time, looking for a champion to take Evie to her family.  She'd heard of the Hunter, but couldn't see her, because the hunter is effectively invisible to most forms of detection magic.</p>

<p>In August (around the same time the Hunter went back in time, during the previous book), the Fates appeared to her in a vision, telling her the Hunter was on the way, to take Evie to family.</p>

<p>She asks if the Fates can be trusted and the Hunter somewhat reluctantly agrees, because she at least trusts them to help her against Vogerath.  That reassures Evelyn she did the right thing and she passes on, vanishing from sight.</p>

<p>The Hunter comforts Evie for a time, before the rapidly-aging woman says she's tired and lonely.  The Hunter pats her back and Riley steps in, for a group hug.</p>

<p>He reminds Evie, "You're not alone."</p>

<p>After that, Evie asks to be left alone, for a nap.  She also corrects her accent mid-sentence, finally figuring out how to pronounce the letter L, promising to make Simmons visible, once she's rested.</p>

<p>As Riley and the Hunter leave the bedroom, Riley expresses his worry that Evie might not stop growing older, because she's now in her mid-forties!</p>

<p>There's a brief scene in which Evie is alone with her thoughts and she briefly considers suicide, that she might be with her friends.  The first of the monks that died was a woman with depression issues, who took her own life, though Evie hadn't understood that at the time.  Having seen how that didn't solve anything, she decides against suicide.</p>

<p>She doesn't realize it, but she's growing older by the moment and she's already rapidly headed toward a death by natural causes, though her aging slows as she falls asleep.</p>

<p>Some time later, Evie calls out for help.  Riley and the Hunter rush in, finding Evie on the floor: she fell out of bed and can't get up, because she's now over ninety years old!</p>

<p>They help her back into bed.  She offers to make Simmons visible and the Hunter prepares by hauling Mashu'ra out of her hat.</p>

<p>Simmons appears and thanks Mashu'ra for giving him the chance to fight demons.  Next, he tells them both he loves them and admits this is going to be goodbye for a long time, though he'll wait until the end of time to see the Hunter again, if required.</p>

<p>He also discusses the fact that he knows neither of them will let go of life until the demon threat is permanently solved.</p>

<p>Finally, he addresses the elephant in the room, asking the Hunter to let him go, because she's been dragging him through life like a boat anchor.  He isn't angry, because she had no idea her magic had responded to her emotions by binding his spirit to her, but he <em>is</em> upset that he can't pass on.</p>

<p>Last of all he says: "Go ahead and treasure the time we had together, but don’t hold onto me so tight."</p>

<p>The Hunter enters her internal mindscape, like the way she fought Sogliun, seeking the deepest, darkest corner of her mind, where she buries things she doesn't want to deal with.</p>

<p>This turns out to be a steel-lined corridor, along which hangs paintings, each of which is a different traumatic memory.  Two examples are the death of her parents and Reggie's death.  She takes the painting of Reggie's final moments off the wall and puts it under her arm as she goes deeper, seeking the darkest corner of the place.</p>

<p>She ends up at a dead end dominated by a piece of raw canvas that's been riveted to the wall, which displays the death of Simmons on an eternal loop.</p>

<p>She goes off somewhere else for a ladder and drill of the old hand-cranked variety.  She sets up the ladder and manually drills out every last rivet, taking the canvas down, though that leaves the wall bleeding.  She rolls up the canvas and carries it away.</p>

<p>She returns to the usual corner of her mindscape and as an experiment, she sets the painting of Reggie's final moments on fire, with magic.  It turns into smoke that fills the shadows surrounding her, which are actually her memories.  The return of that buried memory is painful, but it brings with it a flood of good memories that she'd been forced to bury with it, because they were connected.  She's finally able to look back on her time with Reggie, feeling joy.</p>

<p>She next lights the bloody canvas aflame, releasing the full pain of loss into her mind.  It really hurts, but she's ready to really deal with it and find a way forward.</p>

<p>Her inner demon (The Eighth Deadly Sin, Willful Insanity, or Insanity for short) hugs her in a surprising turn of events, because Insanity was born from the Hunter's Id, which is all about emotion.</p>

<p>Back in the real world, she tries to say, "I love you", though it comes out as "It's a secret."</p>

<p>Simmons responds, "I love you, too."</p>

<p>Mashu'ra also says goodbye and Simmons fades away.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Evie has grown translucent, because she's also fading!</p>

<p>Riley is upset, because he basically gained a daughter and now she's dying, in less than a day's time.</p>

<p>Evie tells them what she just realized: She didn't understand it at the time, but she's been dead for a great many years.  When she faced the demon that killed the monks, she blasted him with such a potent burst of life magic, she erased the demon magic in both her own body and that of the demon, killing them both.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of fairies (which is technically what the beings calling themselves demons in these novels are), Evie rose again in the same way Lara did in the previous book.</p>

<p>In the end, it hardly made a difference, because she'd never understood, until that morning, and the nature of her Spirit powers allowed her to freely cross the divide between the living and dead.</p>

<p>With her attachment to life fading, Evie is now ready to pass on.</p>

<p>Before she goes, she tells Riley something Evelyn told her: the woman he's been carrying a torch for feels the same, so he should marry her and have lots of kids.  He promised he'll soon have a daughter again.</p>

<p>He thanks her for that message.</p>

<p>The Hunter is sad, of course, because she'd been looking forward to visiting Evie from time to time, thinking they would be friends for thousands of years to come.</p>

<p>She tries and fails to express herself, saying, "It's a secret."</p>

<p>Evie smiles and slips back into her Chinese accent, "I ruv you, too."</p>

<p>She fades from sight, leaving a set of empty clothes behind.</p>

<p>After a scene break, the Hunter steps outside, in tears, mourning both Simmons and Evie, finally understanding the meaning of 'bittersweet'.  Looking back on her time with Reggie, however, she feels nothing but joy at having known him and the pain is gone, giving her confidence that she'll someday feel the same about Simmons.</p>

<p>Too distracted to pay attention, she bumps into a huge man in a biker's leather jacket and looks up at a squirrel's head!</p>

<h2>Part Four: Grounded</h2>

<p>Chapter 38 marks the end of Part Three and Chapter 39 will begin Part Four.</p>

<p>This part will cover the climax, in which the Hunter will face Ulmoch, leading to her capture, followed by a battle with Wrath and his arch demon wedding guests.</p>

<h2>Chapter 39: Chasing the Rabbit</h2>

<p>Ulmoch starts to tell the Hunter he's set a bomb on a timer, which will go off if she doesn't face him, only to realize, mid-sentence, he forgot to set the timer.  He tries to excuse himself, to go set it.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Hunter cuts his head off with her sword, intending to threaten him until he tells her where to find the bomb, but she's momentarily forgotten the fact such a wound won't disable Ulmoch's body (on her personal timeline, the last time she fought him was a couple years ago).</p>

<p>Ulmoch catches his head and runs off, while the Hunter gives chase.  He briefly trips on a bicycle (his head was facing the wrong way, because he was too busy talking), but loses no momentum, rolling down the sidewalk for a time.  Once his head is reattached, he leaps from one residential roof to another, while the Hunter flies after him.</p>

<p>Ulmoch uses hairpin turns to avoid her, while subtly navigating his way toward a low-rent area of Alice Springs.  He's more dexterous than she is and able to stay out of reach.  She tries using fire magic from her hands to turn better and starts to catch up, only for Ulmoch to accelerate, as if he's intentionally staying just out of reach.</p>

<p>Finally, he goes in a straight line and the Hunter thinks she's got him, only for him to drop between houses and enter one. She overshoots and smashes her way in through the front window, sending a hail of sharp fragments into Ulmoch!</p>

<p>He rolls sideways and ends up next to an old, hand-cranked record player, which is ready to go.  He starts it up and it crackles in the background as the Hunter catches him by the neck and slams him into the wall, putting her sword very near his eye.</p>

<p>She's so angry, her eyes glow an intense, blue shade.</p>

<p>Ulmoch surrenders and says he'll show her where the bomb is, if she'll let go of him.</p>

<p>She puts him down and he instead reaches into his jacket at high speed, yelling, "Psych!"</p>

<p>He produces the jar of liquid he's been saying he got as a present for her and throws it at the ceiling, where it smashes, causing the liquid to spatter down on the both of them!  It's LSD, by the way.  Nearly a whole pint of the stuff.</p>

<p>While Ulmoch sort of just accepts the high with pleasure, the Hunter stumbles around as the room becomes more colorful and spins around her, as if her head were mounted on a swivel.</p>

<p>She mutters, "It's a secret?" followed by her inner demon using her lips, "What the-" she finishes by cursing.</p>

<p>The next scene is inside the Hunters mindscape, where rainbows pieces the perpetual smoky shadows, chasing them away, while the sun shines from under the feet of the Hunter and Insanity.</p>

<p>Years of carefully maintained self-control by the Hunter erodes under the onslaught of the drugs, forcefully drawing her two halves together, where they splash and merge, like droplets of molten metal, reforming as a single individual.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sogliun has been watching the house from the other side of the street and is really surprised to see it melting like wax, while every color of light shines from within.  He analyzes the magic of the air, finding nearly every form of it he recognizes, though Void and Life magic are most prevalent.</p>

<p>He growls, "Ulmoch, what did you do?"</p>

<p>We switch back to the young woman having her first drug experience, but I pointedly don't refer to her as the Hunter.  In fact, she struggles with the very question of who she is.</p>

<p>She stands in a sunny field of grass and flowers, with rainbows flying like birds, surrounded by a landscape that's singing along to the song <em>White Rabbit</em>, by Jefferson Airplane.  The flowers sing soprano, the sun and rainbows are tenors, the stars of the sky sing alto and the ground itself produces a pleasant bass.  She initially thinks the cartoonish landscape is beautiful.</p>

<p>The song refers to Alice from <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em> and she comes to believe her name is Alice and the story her mother read to her as a child is her own story, while the memories that crawl around inside her skull, like ants, obviously are not her own (memories of the Hunter and Insanity).  That's a little hint that Alice is a brand-new personality, brought on by a drug overdose.</p>

<p>Having solved the identity issue, she looks at her magic clothes, which have gone absolutely berserk in response to her thoughts and feelings, unable to settle on a style or color.</p>

<p>She says, "Stop that" and her clothes settle on a long, blue dress with a white apron, a pair of fingerless, elbow-length gloves and a blue, silk top hat, while her hair turns blond and hangs loose.</p>

<p>She finally notices a pair of items in either hand, including a bit torn from a white mushroom cap and a bottle of dark liquid, labeled, 'DRINK ME'.</p>

<p>Feeling an urge to eat, Alice goes with the flow and bites into the mushroom.  As a result, she grows quite large.</p>

<p>From Sogliun's perspective, the house explodes into melted droplets as Alice shoots through the roof and the reality-warping power she's manifested rolls outward, spreading her reality-warping physical hallucination to the neighborhood!</p>

<p>Humans run in every direction and even Sogliun seeks distance, because he doesn't want to be caught up in it.</p>

<p>Naturally, he blames Ulmoch.</p>

<p>Alice decides she doesn't like being large and takes a swig of 'DRINK ME'.  It tastes mostly of fruit, but she can pick out a little turkey dinner mixed in.  She shrinks just as fast as she grew, ending up shorter than the grass, beside a caterpillar smoking from a hookah.</p>

<p>The Ulmoch-become-caterpillar asks, "How high am I?  This is like nothing I've ever seen!  Is this real or is reality as high I am?"</p>

<p>Realizing she overshot, Alice nibbles on the mushroom and returns to approximately normal size, finding herself standing beside a small apple tree covered in green apples, with a golden one near the top.</p>

<p>The dream-like beauty fades as the landscape turns hostile (the LSD is finally getting through her skin and her trip is turning bad, as a result) and the flowers grow fangs, trying to bite her ankles, though that doesn't matter, because she's wearing boots.</p>

<p>The rainbows, on the other hand, become a deadly problem as they swoop at her, their edges cutting her like razor blades!  Seeking to defend herself, she calls up the Hunter's wakizashi and deflects them.</p>

<p>As she fights, the landscape changes to a chess board on which a battle between the red and white armies takes place!  She realizes the rainbows were actually the men fighting and they only cut her by mistake.</p>

<p>The Red Queen screams, "Off with their heads!" to encourage her men and Alice, being in a drug-induced suggestible state, swings her sword as she spins like a ballerina.</p>

<p>The Ulmoch/caterpillar has apparently changed size along with her and loses his head to her twirl, complaining, "Oh, come on!  I thought we were finally getting along!"</p>

<p>She grabs Ulmoch's caterpillar head out of the air before he can catch it and hauls it out of reach.</p>

<p>The song reaches the last line and she takes it as an instruction.  Looking on the severed caterpillar head, she finds herself looking into the eyes of her own severed head.  She grabs the golden apple from the tree and forcefully rams it into the head's mouth, incidentally shattering teeth in the process.  With the stem facing toward her, she plucks it off and hurls the head away, because instinct tells her something energetic is about to happen.</p>

<p>Ulmoch's head sails out of the reality distortion and returns to normal.  So does the high-explosive anti-personnel grenade she called up from the Hunter's arsenal, which is inside his mouth.  It explodes and Ulmoch is sent home, where it takes him weeks to heal properly.  It was such a bad trip for him, he stays sober for three full months.</p>

<p>Feeling sick, Alice pukes, while the LSD dribbles form her clothes as they magically self-clean.  She finally lays down, to sleep off the high.</p>

<p>Solgiun notes the unreality bubble reversing course and it eventually vanishes, leaving most everything as it was before it appeared.  He reluctantly enters the house and finds Wrath's intended out cold, so he calls for pickup, quite surprised that Ulmoch actually succeeded in knocking her out.</p>

<h2>Chapter 40: Final Preparations</h2>

<p>Alice is captured by Wrath's minions, but in the process of getting her on a pallet with a binding circle on it, her hat falls off.  One of the demons tries to pick it up.  The hat eats them, both as the means to defend itself, but also to gain some extra energy.</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, the Hunter's father, Jake, gets the energy he needs to maintain the pocket dimension inside the hat from the Hunter, but when the hat is separated from her, he's on his own, so he uses the traces of demonic magic available to him to consume any demon that dares to touch it.</p>

<p>He needs the extra energy, lest he be forced to start discarding things stored inside, as he once did in 1972, throwing out dinner rolls to maintain sufficient energy.</p>

<p>In the next scene, Lara arrives at Riley's home, who tells her the Hunter left an hour earlier.</p>

<p>Lara summons Mashu'ra and he directs her toward the hat.</p>

<p>Alice arrives (still unconscious and captured) at Wrath's abandoned mine base, where Lust gets to work positioning the pallet holding her, in preparation to separate her human and demon sides.</p>

<p>In the background, Gluttony prepares the wedding feast (summoned imps), while a trussed-up justice of the peace awaits being of service, probably followed by being eaten.</p>

<p>Wrath makes arrangements for the other arches to be summoned and the wedding dress is brought in.  Lust tries to remove Alice's clothes, but fails, complaining that they must be glued on. Wrath gives it a go, literally trying to tear them off her, but only tears a small portion, which rapidly repairs itself.</p>

<p>Seeing the magic clothes at work, Lust suggests leaving them be (magic clothes aren't easy to make and can be very useful).  Wrath asks her to put the wedding dress on Alice over them.</p>

<p>Wrath heads off to get dressed and get his hair done, for the first time, ever.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lara arrives at the old wrecked house and puts on the Hunter's hat, surprised by the fact it has turned blue.</p>

<p>She uses the tracking curse Verda put on the Hunter and her hat in 1972 to learn the direction and distance to Alice.  Next, Lara grows bat wings and flies off (with Mashu'ra in her body, the animal forms she can use are limited to mammals).</p>

<h2>Chapter 41: Three for the Price of Two</h2>

<p>Alice finally wakes and looks around at the room, which has all seven arch demons in it.  She tries to leave, because it isn't her kind of scene, only to burn herself on the interior of the one-way force field produced by the binding circle.</p>

<p>She looks down and sees the wedding dress, but doesn't quite make the connection that she's the bride.  She's a little slow on the uptake, like a stoner normally is.</p>

<p>She notes the tuxedo Wrath is wearing and finally realizes she's at a wedding.  She looks down again and realizes she's supposed to be the bride.  The arches laugh at her exclamation of frustration.</p>

<p>She tries to escape with magic, but she's unable to accomplish anything.</p>

<p>Wrath orders her to hold out her left hand and she reasons she can't win, so she goes with the flow and obeys.</p>

<p>Wrath puts the enchanted engagement ring Lust made on her finger, resulting in Alice exploding into a cloud of black smoke.</p>

<p>Switching to Lust's perspective, she's surprised to see not two figures forming from the smoke, but three.  She's also somewhat bothered by her slowly-growing conscience, because she helped put her jailer (the Hunter/Alice) in this position.</p>

<p>Her calculations are all wrong and with three personalities instead of two, none of them will end up inside a binding circle.  She decides that with the plan so far off the rails, it's time to leave, but as she heads toward the exit, Gluttony sends three of her bodyguards after Lust, presumably to kill her.</p>

<p>Seeing no better option for survival, Lust plays into the desires of Greed, who's always had a thing for her, and buddies up to him, using a considerable share of charm magic to wrap him around her little finger.  It's a game she doesn't want to play, but it's better than the alternatives; Greed wishes to possess her, but the others likely want her dead for political reasons.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, manipulating the feelings of a man doesn't sit well with her, because she actually feels guilty about it.</p>

<p>The three figures solidify at the corners of a triangle, free, rather than on the two binding circle pallets that stood ready to catch them.</p>

<p>One is the mutated cat form of Insanity at full-strength, wearing the wedding dress, as planned.  The Hunter's human form is next, but she immediately collapses.  The last is Alice.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32: No Sanctuary</h2>

<p>The upstairs portion of the <em>The Last Sanctuary</em> turns out to be nothing but mummified corpses and they head downstairs, finding the great hall a little different.</p>

<p>First, the fire is much smaller and there's a sort of nest of orange monk robes laid out, where someone has been sleeping.  That's surrounded by little, hand-carved wood figures that are very artistic.</p>

<p>The bear statue has had a pair of glasses drawn on with charcoal and one whole wall is covered in charcoal drawings.  They start primitive at one end and slowly transition to being very well made, hinting at a progression over time.</p>

<p>The incense is all gone, presumably all used up.  The weapons and tools are rusty, but still serviceable, with sings someone has been looking after them.</p>

<p>Near the tree is a chopping block with an ax and carving knife (it's a magic tree that rapidly grows back, by the way, providing limitless wood for the fire).</p>

<p>The room smells of a child.  The Hunter moves closer and sniffs the nest, confirming they sleep there.</p>

<p>They're surprised to hear a child ask, from behind, "What are you doing?"</p>

<p>The Hunter turns to look, but no one's there.</p>

<p>The child points out, from behind, "I'm not there."</p>

<p>Whirling again only causes the kid to giggle from all directions.</p>

<p>Yet again from behind: "Who are you and what’s that rittle furry thing on your shourder?"</p>

<p>Note the spelling.  The kid pronounces L's as R's, using a Chinese accent.</p>

<p>The Hunter turns Mashu'ra around on her shoulder, so he can watch her back.</p>

<p>“You just gonna ignore me?” The child asks from every direction at once.</p>

<p>Tiring of the game, the Hunter closes her eyes, focusing her mind entirely on smell and magic.  As it turns out, the kid is using a technique very similar to the Hunter's shadow-stepping spell, but instead of a mix of Smoke and Void magic, to make shadow, the kid uses Void mixed with Life, forming a ghost-walking spell.</p>

<p>The Hunter gets an idea where the child is next to appear, based on smell and magic, grabbing their clothes.  The result is four years old, with brown eyes and a shaved head, in a child-sized orange robe.</p>

<p>Introductions reveal her name is Evie and it soon becomes clear the girl can see spirits and doesn't realize they're dead, because she asks "Who's the man in the gray suit?" and points at empty space.</p>

<p>They don't know, so she asks him and says he's "Crayton Simmons."  The Hunter is shocked by the revelation that Simmons is so very close, yet so far away.</p>

<p>Evie points all over the room at people her guests can't see, naming them, including a mixture of Western,m Chinese and Russian names, though the name 'Will' turned into 'Wirr', which will probably confuse, not that it matters.</p>

<p>Eventually, Evie asks why they're there and Mashu'ra tells her they're supposed to take her to her family.  She gets excited about it finally being time for "her adventure".</p>

<p>Like a child with a short attention span, she looks at the Hunter and asks if she ever speaks.</p>

<p>The Hunter nods and an amusing exchange happens, in which the Hunter intentionally baits Evie with the only phrase she can say, until she's annoyed the girl, getting her to ask, "Is that the only thing you can say?"</p>

<p>The Hunter nods and Evie grumbles, "That's annoying.  You're annoying!"</p>

<p>The Hunter is quite pleased at this outcome, because she tries very hard to be so.</p>

<p>Evie briefly tries to erase the Hunter's curse, but fails, because it's "rearry strong".</p>

<h2>Chapter 33: A New Lens</h2>

<p>The Hunter leaves the Sanctuary with Evie in two, surprised to see that the courtyard hasn't changed, but the scene across from it has.</p>

<p>The rope bridge now crosses a creek instead of a deep chasm.  The Hunter doesn't know it, but the Sanctuary connected them with an area near Alice Springs, Australia, because the magic of the Sanctuary sensed that was vaguely near where they needed to go.</p>

<p>The Hunter leaves the courtyard and steps onto the sandy bank of the Todd River.  The background is desert scrub brush, including sparse grass, low brush and hardy trees.</p>

<p>She looks back, but the Sanctuary and rope bridge are gone, leaving her in a very short panic, thinking she's lost Evie.</p>

<p>Evie steps out of thin air beside her, amazed by everything she sees.  After asking lots of questions, she wishes she could draw it, even though she left her "drawing warr" behind.</p>

<p>The Hunter gives her a clipboard with some paper and a box of crayons that came form the hat.</p>

<p>Evie draws the most violently-rainbow variation of the landscape, using every color she can, because she's never had colors to draw with before (she's used to charcoal).</p>

<p>After that, she draws it again, using more appropriate colors, and produces an image like unto a photograph, despite using only crayon.  She makes a gift of it to the Hunter.</p>

<p>She wonders aloud what's next and Mashu'ra is forced to admit he's not sure, so Evie asks her grandmother, reveling the fact that the spirits of the monks followed.</p>

<p>After a pause (our heroes can't hear Evenlyn speaking), Evie says, "Yeah?  I can do that."</p>

<p>She raises her arms and pours a mixture of Spirit and Void magic into the air, causing the landscape first to waver like a heat haze, then melt into a puddle like overheated crayons!</p>

<p>Mashu'ra and the Hunter get violently sick and she retches.  Rolling on her back, she looks up at some monks, Evenlyn included, plus Simmons, standing over her and discussing her illness.</p>

<p>The magic reverses and the melted landscape flows upward, into the shape and form of a hill they're now on top of, which give them a nice view of Alice Springs (though they still don't know where they are).</p>

<p>There's a brief conversation in which Mashu'ra asks Evie to warn them before she does that again.</p>

<p>Evie settles in to draw, while the Hunter starts to cry, because seeing Simmons ripped her half-healed wounds open again.  Evie notices her sobbing and hugs her (the Hunter's protective spells curiously don't stop that, indicating her mother refused to intervene).</p>

<p>Evie starts a discussion about the Hunter's tears and Mashu'ra tries to explain that she just lost a friend.  Evie doesn't understand and they begin a long conversation about death, but the Hunter suspects Evie will not understand, because unlike everyone else, she doesn't perceive the divide between the living and the dead.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34: No Home</h2>

<p>Close to an hour late, Mashu'ra has made no progress getting Evie to understand the concept of death and he tries saying, "Ghosts can’t be touched by the living."</p>

<p>Evie proves him wrong by shaking the hand of the unseen ghost of Simmons, though she unknowingly uses a little magic to pull that off.</p>

<p>Mashur'a gives up, "You’ll understand when you’re older."</p>

<p>They decide to enter the city, but just as Mashu'ra is saying he'll be fairly quiet, he vanishes, whisked away by Lara summoning him.</p>

<p>Evie gets an explanation from one of the ghosts haunting them, most likely Simmons, though the Hunter only hears half the conversation.</p>

<p>The girl leads the way into the city, following directions given by her grandmother.</p>

<p>They arrive at a brick house and Evie knocks.  A gruff-looking man answers, but smiles at Evie.</p>

<p>She asks if his surname is "Warrace".</p>

<p>He corrects her by saying "Wallace" and says yes.</p>

<p>Evie hugs his legs and says, "I ruv you, cousin!"</p>

<p>I've had a lot of fun with Evie's Chinese accent, so far, because it makes some of her words amusing and this struck me as one of the cutest things she's said so far.</p>

<p>The man pries her off and looks to the Hunter for an explanation, but Evie explains, "She can’t say much of anything, due to a magic curse."</p>

<p>The poor man looks at the both of them like they're insane and slowly back into his house, before shutting the door and presumably calling the police.</p>

<p>The Hunter grabs Evie's hand and takes here away from the place, while Evie asks if she did something wrong.</p>

<p>In the hunter's mind, it's more a matter of what she hadn't done wrong.</p>

<p>Again, one of the spirits explains, but this leaves the Hunter vaguely disquieted, because she isn't sure what they're telling the girl.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lara is in the New York branch office of the Order, helping with the cleanup and moving operation, while she waits.</p>

<p>She steps into Verda's office, noting the woman's bloodshot eyes, because she's hardly slept since Wrath exploded in her face.</p>

<p>They discuss Verda's fresh case of PTSD for a short while and Lara offers a little advice: Verda should go out and kill some weak demons, to do some good and reassure herself that she's not useless.</p>

<p>Verda agrees to try it.</p>

<p>There's also a brief internal momologue from Lara about her own experiences with PTSD (after she was rescued from Hell by her husband) and the way that very specifically didn't happen after she died and was transformed into a vengeful fey spirit, because fey don't get traumatized by death and instead seek revenge.</p>

<p>Verda asks if Lara has heard from Mashu'ra.  The answer is no, so Verda suggests Lara try summoning him again, even though only three hours have passed; she wishes Artemis were around.  That's a little hint that Verda would feel safe if Artemis were present, because she once killed Wrath.</p>

<p>Lara summons Mashu'ra into her body and relays recent events to Verda, who is very interested in <em>The Last Sanctuary</em>, which has been effectively sealed from the inside for 200 years.</p>

<p>Verda speaks of sending witches in through the "back entrance" to assess the place and get it running again.</p>

<p>Lara tells Mashu'ra she's on her way to Australia and releases him.</p>

<p>The scene ends with Verda asking if Lara needs a flight arranged.</p>

<p>Lara decides against it: “Nah.  Shooting Wrath into space gave me an idea I’ve been looking for an excuse to try…”</p>

<p>What she's referring to will be revealed, later.</p>

<p>Getting back to the hunter and Evie, they've tried three more distant relatives of the Wallace bloodline, who (sadly) want nothing to do with her, though they were polite about it and her childish enthusiasm is starting to fade and she grows slightly older (I mean this literally, not figuratively) with each rejection.</p>

<p>They bump into a young woman in the street that's eager to talk to them, because they're obviously foreigners.</p>

<p>Evie learns a few new words/phrases, including 'American', 'Australia' and 'the world', each requiring explanation and the Hunter produces a globe from her hat as a visual aid.</p>

<p>This leads the woman to make a joke, "You the magician or the little one’s lovely assistant?"</p>

<p>Amused, the hunter leans into the idea and pulls Mashu'ra from her hat, grateful he's back, because she doesn't entirely trust the ghosts to give Evie current and correct information, even though Evelyn, at least, is oddly up to date on where her family is.</p>

<p>She does a ventriloquist-like act, allowing Mashu'ra to talk in her place, which actually works a little too well, drawing attention.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Evie is confused, thinking the world and the globe are the same thing.</p>

<p>After an explanation of the difference, Evie shakes the globe and is very much relieved when it doesn't result in an earthquake.</p>

<p>The Hunter grows uncomfortable with the crowd she's accidentally drawn and leads Evie away.</p>

<p>When they're alone, Mashu'ra asks if they'd had any luck and Evie bursts into tears, because she feels like she has nowhere to belong.</p>

<p>The Hunter hugs the girl and finally realizes she's grown attached, much to her frustration.  She'd intended to get the job of delivering Evie to family done, without emotional involvement.</p>

<p>Mashu'a comforts Evie.  The Hunter also cries.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35: Family</h2>

<p>Evie and the Hunter are guided to several more homes of distant relatives by the ghost of Evelyn, but none of them works out, because the people in question have no room in their life for a random relative they didn't know existed.</p>

<p>They decide to quit for the night and Evie is directed by the ghost of Simmons to the local branch office of the Order.</p>

<p>They meet Riley Wallace, the man in charge of the place.  On hearing his name, Evie runs to him and after a short explanation, he hugs her. Riley admits he saw Evelyn in a dream, months earlier, in which she asked him to look after a girl.</p>

<p>He wasn't sure about the dream, but his own grandmother (a witch) advised him to do as he was told, so he prepared a room in his home for her.</p>

<p>It's a rather emotional moment when he tells Evie she has a home.  Evie is so happy, she cries profusely and thanks him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36: Brekky</h2>

<p>Lara is on a sub-orbital spaceflight, in the form of a missile, the quickest option she knows to get to Australia.</p>

<p>At the apogee of her flight, she admires the incredible view of both the Earth and the stars.</p>

<p>She falls back into the atmosphere and changes form, to give herself a heat shield, sacrificing some skin to handle the friction of re-entry.  Lara survives the friction burns and turns back into a missile for a while, performing a retrograde burn (reverse thrust) to slow herself down.</p>

<p>When the conditions are right, she turns into an eagle and flies to the ground, where she re-takes human form.</p>

<p>Her arms are badly burned and she's low on energy, so she lays down to relax and accidentally falls asleep.</p>

<p>Three aborigine men find her, two you fellows and one old guy.  They saw her come down like a shooting star and even watched her change shape.</p>

<p>The first hypothesis floated is that she's an angel, like some catholic guys once mentioned to them.</p>

<p>Next, they consider the possibility that she's a monster.</p>

<p>The old guy eventually decides that no angel or monster would look 
English and finally settles on a correct answer: she's a witch, a kind of magic foreigner woman.</p>

<p>They still debate what they should do, but ultimately decide to help her, because she's less likely to harm helpful people, on top of it being the neighborly thing to do.  They gather herbs and treat her wounds.</p>

<p>When she wakes, she's fully healed (mixture of medicinal herbs and her own regenerative magic).  The local men have gotten a fire going and they sit on the opposite side of it, eyeing her.  Not stated, but they put the fire between themselves and her as an extra measure of protection.</p>

<p>She thanks them and gets up to go, but her stomach growls and they kindly offer her brekky (Aussie slang for breakfast).</p>

<p>She's given a handful of live bugs to eat, including a fat caterpillar.  Not wanting to be rude, she actually eats everything, though it all tastes disgusting.</p>

<p>The two young guys roll on the ground with laughter, while the old one produces a can of beans, a small cooking pot and a can opener, which he's been hiding behind himself.</p>

<p>He asks, “Would ya like some beans, mate?  After what ya just ate, I can imagine ya’d like something normal to help ya forget.”</p>

<p>Lara can't help but laugh at their practical joke, while the old guy opens the can and dumps it in the pot.</p>

<h2>Chapter 37: Home at Last</h2>

<p>The Hunter waits for Evie to wake as morning arrives.  Evie sleeps in a bedroom setup by Riley, wearing pajamas that feature a little, black-furred, helicopter pilot kitty, flying through a sky filled with violently-colorful stars and rainbows that offend and wound the Hunter's sense of fashion.</p>

<p>Evie goes from having the body of a prepubescent twelve year old to that of a fifteen year old, having matured a bit more in the instant before she wakes.</p>

<p>The Hunter helps her dress, because she needs assistance with certain feminine undergarments that hadn't previously been necessary.  Riley stocked the closet of the bedroom with clothing ranging in age from infant to adult, because he didn't know the age of the girl he was to care for.</p>

<p>They step out of the bedroom, where Riley makes breakfast in the form of fried eggs.  Evie tries an egg and pukes ten minutes later, demonstrating her digestive tract is setup the same as the Hunter's.</p>

<p>Riley and Evie talk and the Hunter gets up to leave, because she's finally certain Evie will be safe and secure.  As the Hunter waves and opens the door to go, Evie finally comes to understand loss, in the form of losing a friend.</p>

<p>She begs the Hunter not to go and even offers to let her see Simmons if she'll stay, an obvious attempt at emotional manipulation.</p>

<p>A bargain is struck through gesture: the Hunter will stay for one day, then she leaves, regardless.</p>

<p>The spirits brow-beat Evie for her behavior and she apologizes to the Hunter for manipulating her feelings.</p>

<p>Eventually, Evie brings up the subject of death, because she wants to understand.</p>

<p>To address the subject, Riley takes them to a cemetery and the grave of his parents, who died in a car accident the year before.</p>

<p>He explains that their bodies are buried there and why (mostly cleanliness).</p>

<p>As a result of the conversation, he mentions "passing on" and Evie asks for an explanation of that concept.</p>

<p>Riley explains his views of the afterlife and a primitive variation of eternal joy vs. eternal punishment.</p>

<p>Evie asks why her friends haven't passed on and Riley suggests she ask them.</p>

<p>Riley and the Hunter step back, while Evie does exactly that, for quite some time.  Evie begins to cry at what she learns from them.</p>

<p>She returns to her living companions with a guilty expression and explains they haven't passed on, because she won't let them (it's a mixture of their own unfinished business, needing to see Evie safe and happy, plus her magic anchoring them to the living world).</p>

<p>She's deeply troubled by the idea of letting go of her friends.</p>
