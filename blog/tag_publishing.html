<p>On Monday morning a reporter for the local newspaper (The Leader &amp; Times) interviewed me and today, <a href="https://www.liberalfirst.com/local-sports-4/15169-liberal-author-announces-new-books%E2%80%99-releases" title="Liberal author announces new books’ releases">the article was posted online</a>.</p>

<p>I know I was a nervous wreck, but she did a good job of turning my ramblings into a coherent news article.  Never once did I consider the possibility that I might be interviewed by a reporter, but hopefully, this will get the word out to locals, at least.  I know I can definitely use the extra sales and it stands to reason, those that read newspapers are more likely to read books.</p>

Available for Pre-Order: Forgotten Legends!

<p>The second volume of <em>The Wizard's Scion</em> series, titled <em>Forgotten Legends</em>, is now available for pre-order as an Ebook.  The print edition should follow, soon.</p>

<p><em>Forgotten Legends</em> releases on November 13, 2023.</p>

<p><a href="https://books2read.com/b/ForgottenLegends" title="Forgotten Legends"><img src="../images/Cover-ForgottenLegends.jpeg" alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Levi hated the monster from under the bed as a child, but when he meets the creature as a young adult, he quickly learns nothing will be the same in his life, ever again.  The creature of darkness pleads for his aid in a coming war and the young wizard reluctantly agrees, making it his familiar.</p>

<p>Levi’s family and friends are soon caught up in a galaxy-wide war to decide the fate of humanity and continually come face to face with monsters straight out of myth and legend, including the dreaded Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse! The old gods and monsters humanity revered before the rise of science and reason are angry over being ignored and seek to force humanity to believe in them once more!</p>

<p>The young wizard’s allies find themselves in a unique position to fight the supernatural creatures, since they’re gifted with magical powers of their own, soon sparking a wave of resistance from the governments of the galaxy, as they take the fight to the legends!</p>

<p>However, the battle isn’t easy, because the forgotten legends weren’t idle over the millennia, having built an impressive manufacturing facility that draws matter straight from a star to build warships at an incredible rate, churning them out faster than humanity can deal with! Worse yet, these ships have the very best in weaponry that both magic and science can produce.</p>

<p>Will Levi and his family overcome the endless waves of disposable warships or will the governments of the galaxy be crushed by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, beginning an era of slavery under the heel of their own forgotten legends? The answers lay within this book, but you’ll never know unless you buy it!</p>

Coming Soon: Forgotten Legends

<p>The artwork for the next volume of The Wizard's Scion is nearly complete, so I'm back in full edit mode, to give the text one final pass of polishing before publishing, since Ryan (the artist) moved far faster than I expected, this time.</p>

<p>Forgotten Legends will likely be released as an Ebook in the next week or two.  The print edition should follow on a short delay, as I intend to upload files and complete the work for both on the same day, this time.</p>

<p>This is really exciting to me, because Forgotten Legends is my favorite of the five books in the series, with lots of fun things related to monsters and mythology.</p>

<p>It also has some mild horror elements written from the perspective of the monsters, which is not within my usual writing wheelhouse, but I'm particularly proud of the first and second chapters, as well as the chapter involving Strangers.</p>

<p>Then there's the chapter involving a Kaiju vs. giant robot fight.  That's just all-around fun and shows the far-reaching consequences of the war.</p>

<p>I also love the book for the chance it gives the protagonist to really grow up.  In Troll Song, Levi was introduced as an immature teen.  In Forgotten Legends, he's forced to face the the harsh realities of war and he'll never be the same, again.</p>

<p>I also love the lasting consequences of the novel, because it perfectly sets the stage for the three to follow, directly leading to the rise of old enemies in the Third Wish, the unexpected redemption of a villain in Dark Moon and the capstone of the series, The Inverted Glass, where Levi faces the greatest of challenges on the path to mastering his wizardly powers, with the fate of everyone he loves at stake.</p>

Waking after thousands of years frozen sleep in a world of wonders both scientific and magical, Nicole steals a powerful star ship and the contest begins anew!</p>

<p>Will Lyra defeat her murderous sister and end the troll threat or will Nicole destroy Lyra’s mind to fulfill her vow of vengeance, followed by raiding and pillaging as she sees fit? Buy this book and find out, today!</p>
