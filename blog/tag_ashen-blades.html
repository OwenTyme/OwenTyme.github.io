The half-demon protagonist of She Hunts Demons has no known name, but instead a series of nicknames.  Her friends call her The Boss, Little Miss Secret, Little Miss or LMS, while her enemies call her lots of unpleasant things, the least offensive and repeatable of which are half-demon brat or simply brat.  She calls herself The Hunter.</p>

<p>At the age of three years old, her parents were murdered in front of her by a demon, so she grew up on the streets of New York City, with only her mother's familiar, Mashu'ra, to look after her.</p>

<p>She lives with a curse from the murderer that makes her functionally mute.  Thus, she's devoted her life to exterminating demon-kind with extreme prejudice.  Due to the way the mind of a small child can paper over harsh memories, she initially had no true understanding of why she hated demons so much, but the memory is brought back to her mind in the early chapters of the book, when she kills a child-eating demon, then when her private detective partner, Simmons, stumbles across the name of the killer on an investigation she had no idea was related, it all comes into sharp focus.</p>

<p>She suffers in silence for a time, but Simmons eventually suggests drawing what's on her mind and she's able to tell him the story.  Together, they puzzle out its true meaning and she finally comes to truly understand the loss of her parents.</p>

<p>LMS is widely considered crazy by enemies and allies, alike, because she's incredibly driven and beyond stubborn.  She never admits defeat and becomes incredibly dangerous when cornered.  For example, when a chandelier is dropped on her, pinning her to the floor, she pulls the pin of a grenade and allows it to go off, nearly on top of herself, because if she's going to die, she may as well take some demons with her.</p>

<p>Aside from that, LMS is a deeply emotional individual, because emoting is one of the few ways she can communicate effectively.</p>

<p>She's mischievous, with a love for playing an occasional prank during idle times and loves watching the mayhem that ensues when people try to shake her hand (see below, regarding the protective spell surrounding her).  Her mischievous streak becomes downright cruel when she faces demons and her pranks then become lethal or painful.</p>

<p>Due to the way her parent died, she has great love and compassion for humans, especially small children.</p>

<p>In many ways, she resembles a house cat: she moves with grace, can climb almost anything, she can survive falls from extreme height, she's playful, but cruel to her prey (demons) and she even has a tail, which is normally hidden by her skirt.  This is all because her mother's demon form was that of a feline.</p>

<p>As a half-demon, she inherited the full powers of a demon, including rapid healing, supernatural strength, the ability to conjure weapons to her hands from a pocket dimension inside her top hat and the ability to teleport from shadow to shadow.</p>

<p>Like demons, she survives on raw life force, but unlike them, she can survive on the ambient energy of a city, without murdering humans.</p>

<p>Her demon powers give her Smoke, Shadow and Void magic.</p>

<p>She also happens to be a powerful witch, giving her Fire magic, but she doesn't realize this until late in the first novel.</p>

<p>In addition, LMS is surrounded by a unique, sentient spell that protects her, which is what her demon-witch mother, Annmarie Nosset, transformed herself into when she died, as the means to avoid the eternal punishment that awaited her in Hell.  Annmarie has the ability to subtly manipulate probability to ensure LMS doesn't come to harm, causing unlikely accidents to those that would dare try.  This also affects anyone that tries to touch the girl against her will.  However, there are some significant caveats to how this spell works, which can't protect her from unintentional, indirect or blind attacks.</p>

<p>For example, in the case of the chandelier, the demon responsible had simply been waiting for the lights of the room to come on to cut the rope, without ever knowing the reasons for his orders.  Another example is the case of LMS facing an angry witch.  LMS tried to get rid of the girl with a warning shot, but she grazed the witch's ear, instead.  The witch lost control and a whirlwind spun LMS in the air until she was violently ill.</p>

<p>Like Annmarie, the father of LMS, Jake Watson, is always near.  When Jake died, his spirit latched onto his old top hat, which LMS now wears.  He dwells within the pocket dimension inside the hat as a bound ghost and his powers are integral to how the hat functions.</p>

<p>Little Miss Secret has one additional ally who's nearly always present: her mother's familiar, Mashu'ra, lives inside her hat, where he looks after her weapons for her and keeps a watchful eye on events outside, at least when he's not napping.  Mashu'ra also keeps Jake company, telling him what's going on in the real world.</p>

<p>In exchange for his service, LMS feeds Mashu'ra hot dogs.</p>

Fresh Release: She Hunts Demons

<p><em>She Hunts Demons</em> is the first volume of a new series titled <em>Ashen Blades</em>.  It's heavy with action, magic, demons, witches, gunplay, conspiracies, a demon's plot to rule the world and an extra helping of wild and woolly weirdness, all in a Film-Noir inspired setting.</p>

<p>I enjoyed writing the dialog, which uses 1940's idioms.  I also played around with many Film-Noir tropes, which is why I wanted a mostly black and white cover.</p>

<p>It was a challenging piece to write, but it was also immensely fun, because the protagonist is functionally mute, speaking largely though actions rather than words.  She's also the most cocky character I've ever written, so it's probably a good thing she couldn't voice her absurdly stubborn level of self-confidence, which sometimes borders on the insane.</p>

<p>I apologize to those that were anticipating the next volume of <em>The Wizard's Scion</em>, but the third book of this new series, <em>Demon for President!</em> (which I'm in the middle of writing), takes place on the backdrop of the current presidential election, so I'm pressed for time and working to get this new series established so I can publish that piece in a timely fashion, probably in April.</p>

<p>The next book published should be <em>Ashen Blades</em> volume 2, <em>She Goes to War</em>.</p>

<p>You can rest assured: <em>The Wizard's Scion</em> will be published in its entirety, but for now it must wait on the back burner.  Again, I'm sorry, but please take a look at <em>She Hunts Demons</em>.  I doubt you'll be disappointed.</p>

<p>The half-demon girl who calls herself the Hunter never really considered why she wanted all demons dead, but when she’s presented with the one responsible for killing her parents, she loses all rationality, going on the warpath.</p>

<p>It started with a crying widow and a stack of letters, leading the Hunter’s private detective partner, Clayton Simmons, to investigate a series of financial crimes. These threads all lead to the mysterious Otto Vogerath, who’s rumored to be a mobster.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Hunter’s earliest memories begin coming into focus, giving her clarity about the death of her parents at the hands of the very same, because Vogerath isn’t just a mobster: he’s also a demon that claims to be the serpent from the Garden of Eden.</p>

<p>The duo and their allies are soon caught in a complex spider’s web of mystery, involving conspiracies, murders, atom bombs and the demon’s plot to tear a massive hole in reality, all of which revolves around the life of the Hunter. Worse still, the demon requires the Hunter’s cooperation for his plans to succeed and will do almost anything to get it, repeatedly proving to her that everyone she cares for is in danger, so long as she stands in the way of what he wants.</p>

<p>Will Simmons and the Hunter save the world or will the serpent succeed in opening a portal to Hell, so legions of demons can march forth to conquer the world? The answers lay within this book, but only for those brave enough to buy it!</p>
